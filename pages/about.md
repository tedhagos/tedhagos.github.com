I’ve been writing code since 1988. I started with dBase III+ and Clipper, which means I’m old enough to remember when "cloud computing" was just called "somebody else's computer."

Currently, I'm the **CTO at RenditionDigital International**. Most of my day is spent on software architecture and technical strategy, but I still spend my nights down the rabbit hole of compiler design and Small Language Models.

### The Books
In a fit of industriousness, I ended up writing **8 technical books for Apress**. They cover things like Android Studio, Kotlin, Java, and Game Development. If you've ever tried to learn IntelliJ IDEA or Kotlin for Spring, there's a non-zero chance you've read something I wrote. 

### The "Intellectually Lazy" Philosophy
I’m a big fan of being "intellectually lazy." To me, that doesn't mean doing less; it means being so annoyed by repetitive tasks that you build a system to automate them. I’m currently applying this to **AiDevPress**, where I’m exploring how to use Private RAG systems to make technical books more interactive and less... static.

### Research & Stuff
I keep a foot in the academic world because I like to know *why* things work, not just *that* they work.

* I'm a verified researcher on **ResearchGate** (where my interest score is oddly high at 48.4) and **Semantic Scholar**.
* I have an **ORCID iD** ([0009-0003-1079-000X](https://orcid.org/0009-0003-1079-000X)) because apparently, there are several Ted Hagos-es out there, and I wanted to make sure I’m the right one.
