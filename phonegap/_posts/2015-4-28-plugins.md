There are plenty of things you can do with phonegap and cordova out of the box, but there are limitations on what you can do with it with the device. If your application requires something that is not offerred within the default API found in the cordova middleware, try to see if a plugin is available. You can look for plugins in the [plugins registry](http://plugins.cordova.io/)

# Add a Plugin 

~~~
cd path/to/your/project
cordova plugin add <plugin uri>
~~~

The **plugin uri** is the link of the plugin you want to add the project. When you search for a plugin in the [registry](http://plugins.cordova.io/), the plugin page will detail the uri. You can simply copy and paste the link to a terminal window and you're good to go. For example, to add a network information plugin to a project, we can use the following command

~~~
cordova plugin add https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-network-information.git
~~~

The `cordova plugin add` command will add the plugin for the platforms, iOS, Android, Windows etc. If you want to add a plugin for a specific platform, use [plugman](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/4.0.0/plugin_ref_plugman.md.html).
