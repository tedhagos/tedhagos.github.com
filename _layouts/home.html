<h1>Hi, I’m Ted Hagos.</h1>

<p>
    I write about software careers, engineering maturity, and the economics of
    boring technology.
</p>

<p>
    I’ve been writing code since the late 80’s and working professionally in
    tech since the late 90s. Over nearly three decades, I’ve been a developer,
    an author, and an instructor. I also spent the better part of two decades in
    technical management, overseeing everything from C++ and .NET to iOS and
    React.
</p>

<p>
    While I have deep roots in Java and Android, my perspective is mostly shaped
    by watching technologies rise, peak, and eventually become the "legacy"
    systems someone else has to fix.
</p>

<h2>Why listen to me?</h2>

<p>
    I’m interested in the transition from "competent" to "trusted." I’ve seen
    enough project lifecycles to know that the most "clever" solution is rarely
    the one that makes sense three years later. I focus on what survives the
    reality of hiring loops, budget constraints, and long-term maintenance.
</p>

<h3>What I’m thinking about:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>The Seniority Gap:</strong> Why years of experience don't always
        equal seniority, and how to signal true engineering maturity.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The Economics of Code:</strong> Complexity taxes, maintenance
        debt, and why "boring" technology is often a competitive advantage.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Building Leverage:</strong> Using writing and teaching to escape
        the trap of trading every hour of your life for a linear paycheck.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Where I Write</h2>
<p>
    If you need tactical, "how-to" tutorials and concrete skill-building, head
    over to <a href="https://workingdev.net">workingdev.net</a>.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>This site</strong> is for the slow-burning ideas—the stuff that
    connects systems, careers, and the reality of working in tech for the long
    haul.
</p>

<h2>The Newsletter</h2>
<p>
    A few times a week, I send out an essay on software careers and engineering
    maturity. No fluff, just observations from 30+ years of looking at screens.
