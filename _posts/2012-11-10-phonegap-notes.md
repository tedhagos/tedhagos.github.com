These are my notes for the Phonegap SDK. These notes go back to late 2012 but they get updated from time to time. They get revisited specifically when I am conducting a skill building exercises for training participants (training clients).

The setup is deliberately Spartan. No IDE, just plain programming editor. You can use the IDE when you have already mastered the basics and you can navigate the CLI quite comfortably, but not before that.


<h1 class="chapter">DEV ENVIRONMENT</h1>

You need a couple of things before you can get cracking on Phonegap codes. Starting Phonegap 3.0, the development setup has become quite elaborate, streamlined though but more prescriptive than earlier versions.

Phonegap can be used to deploy mobile apps in iOS, Android, WP7, WP8 and Blackberry. That means Phonegap requires that you have the toolchain for these platforms first before you install Phonegap. You don't need to have all of the target platforms, if you will develop iOS and Android apps, then you only need those two.

The [Phonegap Platform Guide](
http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/guide_platforms_index.md.html) is quite detailed on how to prep your environment. It is not necessary to duplicate that content here, you should simply refer to the official Phonegap installation guides to get up to date information on your target platform. For convenience purposes, the instalation steps for *Phonegap + Android installation* is listed here.
