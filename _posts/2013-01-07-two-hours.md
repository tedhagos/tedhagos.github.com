title: The First Two Hours
---

Wake up 2 hours earlier than your usual. After the morning rituals, coffee etc, don't turn on the computer, don't check your email, don't check messages on your phone lest your mind will wander around, will fleet from thought to thought and 
get filled with *little things* &mdash; remember what Stephen Covey said on *First things First*, rocks first, then stones, then pebbles then sand. Look at the rocks first, attend to the rocks first. Stay disconnected for the first two hours. Use the time to;

1. Look at your todo list for the week
2. Look at your todo list yesterday, if some items fell in the crack, add them to the list for the day. Can't steal time
3. Write (rewrite) the todo list for the day. See which ones in the list can be done in 2 hours, but can potentially contribute the most to results of the day (80/20). Be brutal about the selection. Those task that will not make the cut are probably less important anyway&mdash;either delay them, queue them, delete them altogether.

The first two hours is important, it sets the tone of the day. If you don't set the tone, the hours will pass by and you will wander aimlessly; sure you will respond to emails, answer your phone, engage in conversations&mdash;but those are probably the 80% of your activity that gives rise to only 20% of your results (maybe even a lot less than 20%)&mdash;do the important stuff first; the important ones for you, that is.
