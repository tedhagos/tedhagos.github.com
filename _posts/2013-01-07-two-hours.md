title: The first two hours
---

Wake up 2 hours earlier than your usual. After the morning rituals, coffee etc, don't turn on the computer, don't check your email, don't look at cell phone --- stay disconnected for the first two hours. Use the time to;

1. Look at your todo list for the week
2. Look at your todo list yesterday
3. Write (rewrite) the todo list for the day. See which one of task list requires the 20% of effort and could give rise to 80% of the expected results for today. Be brutal about the selection. Those task that will not make the cut are probably less important anyway--Either delay it, queue it, delete it altogether

The first two hours is important, it sets the tone of the day. If you don't set the tone, the hours will pass by and you will wander aimlessly; sure you will respond to emails, answer your phone, engage in conversations---but those are probably the 80% of your activity that gives rise to only 20% of your results (maybe even a lot less than 20%) --- do the important stuff first; the important ones for you, that is.
