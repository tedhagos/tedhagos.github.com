# Orgmode doc to Leanpub Markdown

This is settled already. There is no export to do. Org mode is pre writing. I will write in Markdown when publishing to LeanPub. Practice your typing!
-   What kind of markup do I use
-   Are all of them handled gracefully by the Orgmode exporter
-   If not, what are the solutions. Perhaps sed and awk

-   What happens to footnotes
-   What happens to beginex &#x2013; they are actually respected by LeanPub

## Heading Structure

Keep the #title for the title, but make sure that the chapter title is is heading 1, which meang single asterisk. When you export the document to markdown format, the chapter title becomes heading 1

Use the traditional orgmode. Write as it is.

# How will you handle begin\_example and end\_example

Sed scripts, perhaps
