description: do not spiral into paranoia

Try to avoid mental snowballing. This one usually occurs when you are so absorbed into a negative detail. You will begin rehearsing one thought after another in your mind, you might even rehearse conversations that will eventually make you feel agitated.

Thought rehearsal is good, if it’s a positive thought, if it’s a negative thought, it should be dealt with differently. Out of the 10 (bad) things you think will happen, 1 (or maybe none at all) will happen.  Life is short, time is short&mdash;such a waste to spend it in paranoia
