You will underestimate the efforts on your first API project. Even if you have done many an estimations before and you have participated in many a projects, if none of them were API development, you will be painfully reminded that **there is always a first time for everything**.  

API projects are not exactly the same as a web app, or mobile app or a desktop app. They should not be estimated as such. You will spend more effort on development and unit testing on API projects.  

Once you have built the API, you will spend time testing it. The way to test it is to build an application that will use the API. &mdash; shouldn't you actually build a unit test also for that app that will use your API? If you won't, how will you get an insight on how the APIs will be used by others. You need to get into the heads of your users if the API is to be robust.
