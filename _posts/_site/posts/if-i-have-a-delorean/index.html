<p>There was discussion post in <strong>dev.to</strong> <a href="https://dev.to/sergiotapia/what-is-your-best-advice-for-a-junior-software-developer-32gn">what is your best advise for a junior software developer</a>. I ended up responding with a 15-item, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, advise. Here they are;</p>

<p>If I have Doc Brown’s DeLorean, this is what I would advise my younger self;</p>

<ol>
  <li>Keep your head down during code reviews. Humility goes a long way. They’re not criticizing you, it’s your code they’re after. It’s not personal</li>
  <li>Do the required reading before you get knee-deep in the code. You have a propensity to shoot from the hip, curb that enthusiasm. Don’t read the manual only when you’re in trouble</li>
  <li>Design patterns are nice, but you don’t have to use all of them, all the time in every code you write</li>
  <li>Learn Python early. Get to the Python REPL and type <code class="highlighter-rouge">import this</code>. Learn it by heart, then read no. 3 (above) again</li>
  <li>Coffee, pizza and chips are nice now, but 20 years from now, you’re gonna wish you didn’t eat those</li>
  <li>In a couple of years, social media is gonna be big. Stay out of it</li>
  <li>Those math subjects you hated, better get more comfortable with them. There’s gonna be a thing called “machine learning”, it’s gonna be big, you’re gonna need them maths</li>
  <li>Stop wondering when you will graduate from being a junior, you’ll know it when you’re out of it. When you start making technical choices and you recognize that there are choices to be made; then you’re not so junior anymore</li>
  <li>Be polite when asking questions. If you don’t want to get the RTFM response (a lot), read Eric Raymond’s guide on <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">how to ask smart questions</a></li>
  <li>When you’re tech lead or any of your bosses calls you for a meeting, always bring a pen and paper. Write your notes</li>
  <li>If it’s taking you more than 3 hours to figure out something, ask for help, tell your tech lead what’s eating you up (but make sure that before you do this, you’ve read no. 9 above)</li>
  <li>If you promised your tech lead (client, coworker or boss) you will deliver the thing on Friday, and you’re not gonna make it, tell them early. Don’t tell them on Friday</li>
  <li>Exercise. You’re brain (and your blood pressure) will love you for it</li>
  <li>When the book “Pragmatic programmer, journeyman to master” comes out. Read it</li>
  <li>From time to time, write a program in LOLCODE, don’t lose your humor</li>
</ol>
