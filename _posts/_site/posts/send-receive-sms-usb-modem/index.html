<p>This guide uses gnokii-sms to send and receive SMS messages using Linux PC. The project I was working on did not require industrial grade throughput. That is the reason I cannot justify the cost of WaveComm iTegra type equipment. The SMS project was ran on a Debian Linux. If you are using a different distro, use the packaging mechanism of your distro.</p>

<p>There were a couple of other solution approaches but I went for gnokii-sms. I didn’t have a lot of time, which ruled out whipping serial I/O codes and concocting SMS messages using Hayes AT command set.</p>

<p>I could have used Kannel but it was so big. I only needed a simple mechanism to receve and send SMS message. I did not need a full gateway with all the bells and whistles.</p>

<p>GNOKii-SMS and Gammu were mature solutions. I went eventually with gnokii-sms but Gammu would have been a fit as well.</p>

<p>Hence, this mashup uses gnokii-sms. It is a stand-alone application with a daemon and it uses MySQL database as a datastore. I don’t need to learn any API in order to integrate it with my application. All I need to do is to write an application that will query the gnokii-sms backend. I won’t even alter the structure of the gnokii-sms database. My application will simply use gnokii for the SMS facility. No application logic will be added to gnokii-sms</p>

<p>This little project requires the following</p>

<ol>
  <li>A Linux PC. Debian was used but I got to test it on Crunchbang as well, worked out fine. It should work fairly well on the Debian derivatives e.g. Ubuntu, Xubuntu, Mint etc</li>
  <li>A USB modem. A post paid plan was used for the project, but a USB stick on pre-paid should work just as well</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo apt-get update</code><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo apt-get install mysql-server</code><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo apt-get install gnokii-smsd-mysql</code></p>

<h1 id="config">Config</h1>

<p>Connect the USB modem to PC and find out which port it is using</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo lsusb</code></p>

<p>Another command to use could be</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo dmesg | grep USB</code></p>

<p>What you are looking for is the device name for the modem. Usually, the modem is at <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/tty0</code>, but just to be sure, run either lsusb or the dmesg command as stated above. Remember the device name because you will need it when you edit <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.config/gnokii/config</code> — that is the configuration file for gnokii.</p>

<p>On some Debian derivatives like Crunchbang, the gnokii config file was not created during the installation . If that is the case, just create the config file manually.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo mkdir -p ~/.config/gnokii</code><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo touch ~/.config/gnokii/config</code></p>

<p>Edit the <strong>config</strong> file. Set the port number and model to their appropriate values</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>port=/dev/tty0
model=AT
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There might a default value for the model property, it could be 6510. That value corresponds to a Nokia phone. But we are not using a Nokia phone, we are using a USB modem, so set the model value to <strong>AT</strong>.</p>

<p>Once done with the configuration, just do a quick test so that we know things are working out fine. Gnokii has a command that can quickly tell us if we are doing things correctly.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo gnokii --identify</code></p>

<p>It should give us some diagnostics and a quick peek if we did something wrong on the configuration file.</p>

<h1 id="database-backend">Database backend</h1>

<p>The gnokii-smsd-msyql package contains the SQL scripts necessary to create the table structure, but the database itself still needs to be manually prepared.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">mysql -u root -p</code><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">mysql&gt; create database smsgw;</code><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">mysql&gt; use smsgw;</code><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">mysql&gt; \. /usr/share/doc/gnokii-smsd-mysql/sms.tables.mysql.sql;</code></p>

<h1 id="sending-and-receiving-sms">Sending and Receiving SMS</h1>

<p>First, the daemon smsgw daemon process needs to run. Get another terminal window and run the daemon process from there</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo smsd -u root -p smsgw -c localhost -m mysql</code></p>

<p>To send an SMS message, the command is</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">echo "Test message | gnokii --sendsmsd +MobileNumber</code></p>

<p>+MobileNumber is structured as <span class="underline">(country code) phone number</span></p>

<p>If you send an SMS message to the number of the USB modem, all incoming messages are stored in the <strong>inbox</strong> table of the database</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">mysql -u root -p</code><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">mysql&gt; use smsgw;</code><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">mysql&gt; select * from inbox;</code></p>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.1" name="fn.1" class="footnum" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> There was a gnokii config file though at `/etc/xdg/gnokii/config`, this
