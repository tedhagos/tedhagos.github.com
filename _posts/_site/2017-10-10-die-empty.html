<p>There are 3 kinds of work</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Mapping</strong> - Prioritizing, planning and setting of objectives</li>
  <li><strong>Meshing</strong> - Sharpening the      saw. This is an important determinant of long-term sucess. I’ts difficult      to justify this because it’s not tied directly to results</li>
  <li><strong>Making</strong> - Performing work      that actually crosses out the items in your todo list. This is “doing      the work”. You have a work product. Producing something of value</li>
</ol>

<p>You need to be purposeful in engaging these three kinds of work. You need to do all three in order to succeed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your days are numbered, finite, someday they will run out</li>
  <li>Avoid comfort, that’s dangerous</li>
  <li>Plant seeds today      for a harvest later</li>
  <li>Your body of work      should reflect what’s important to you</li>
  <li>Mediocrity doesn’t      happen suddenly, it develops overtime – you probably got too comfortable,      too complacent. You thought nothing would go wrong and you can stay in      “ the moment”  forever.      This can be a result of current successes being enjoyed e.g. a secured job      (that sounded like an oxymoron, no job is ever secure). Look at it this      way, nobody sets out to be mediocre, everybody dreamed and planned for      rock star level success. Then, life happens</li>
  <li>Define your battles      wisely, and build your life around winning them</li>
</ul>
