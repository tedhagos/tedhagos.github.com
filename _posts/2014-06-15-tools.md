# Simple web server

If you just need to serve up HTML, JS and CSS files, there is no need to setup Apache or NGINX. For quick and dirty testing of a static website, use anyone of these tools.

## http-server, npm

`sudo npm install -g http-server`  
`cd /folder/path/to/html/files/`

Then point your browser to <http://localhost:8080>

## SimpleHTTPServer, python

`cd /path/to/html/files/`  
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

Point the browser to to <http://localhost:8000>

## PHP standalone server

This tool requires a PHP version 5.4 or higher

`cd /path/to/html/files/`  
`php -S localhost:8080`

Obviously, the server is listening on port 8080, so point your browser to it

# RESTful endpoints

## Sinatra

## NodeJS

## Java
