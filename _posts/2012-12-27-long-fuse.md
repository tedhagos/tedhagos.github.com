title: long fuse
---

1. a device in a bomb that controls the timing of an explosion
2. a book by Dr. Eric Haseltine (Long Fuse, Big Bang â€¦)
3. long term goals. not the same as task list items, but each item on the task list should keep the spark going. It's the big picture, the balls you don't drop. It's your marshmallow test. They will not be immediately satisfied. It's not the *here and now*, so you need to be very patient and very cool about it
