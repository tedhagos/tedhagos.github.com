There are certain actions or option in AS3’s Main Menu that doesn’t have a default mapping to the keyboard e.g. entering a full screen view. In such cases,  you may map a keyboard shortcut of your own choosing to a menu action. You can do this in the *keymap settings* for AS3.

-  **Keymaps dropdown** lets you select the desired keymap, it switches between the preset keymaps
- **Actions list**. Right click on an action to modify it. You can add additional keyboard shortcuts for the action, add mouse shortcuts to associate an action with a mouse click, or remove current shortcuts. If you are using a preset keymap, modifying an action’s shortcuts will automatically create a copy of the keymap and add your modifications to the copy
- You can use the **Search Box** to search for a keyboard shortcut using the *action name*
- **Search by shortcut** . You can type the keyboard short cut in this search window to find the action name
