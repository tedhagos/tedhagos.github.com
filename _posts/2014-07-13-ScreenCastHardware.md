1.  Shure PG42 USB Mic
2.  A mixer with phantom voltage, needs to be USB
3.  Camtasia 2 Mac - to Record the screen
4.  Audacity â€” surely, I cannot talk while typing. So I need to have the ability to record the voice on a separate track.

The condenser mic and the mixer is necessary to achieve an acceptably clean audio. So there is no hiss and hum on the audio.
