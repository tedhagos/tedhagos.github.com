title: 480 minutes of focus

excerpt: A non-trivial subject could require 120 minutes of blocked time, these are the kinds of task that (hopefully) will have big pay offs. Hopefully again, you could get at least 2 of these big chunks each day &mdash; but that is constantly threatened by telephone rings, people walking into your workspace, noisy cubicle neighbors and many others. So, do you really need to get interrupted by Twitter, Facebook and that annoying sound your email app makes when something arrives.

That's 8 hours. It's a stretch to increase it, no matter how badly you want to.

Every morning you've got 24 potential-filled hours, sounds like a lot, but after;

- waiting on elevators (.25 hours, cumulatively)
- getting to work (1 hour)
- (actually) working (8 hours) 
- light social activity, water cooler talk (.25 hours)
- lunch (1 hour)
- getting home (1 hour)
- dinner (1 hour)
- hygiene and other physical necessities (1.5 hours)
- get appraised on current events (1 hour)
- sleep (8 hours)

the day is finished.
