**Electronic and Online reproduction.** ummm, I'm not entirely sure about this. I still have an idealistic view of intellectual properties and copyright. I think it's just easier for all of us to just use links &mdash; if you do however, really really need to reproduce anything you find in here, just [drop me note at ted {at} thelogbox {dot} com](mailto:ted@thelogbox.com).
