# WHAT IT SHOULD DO

1. Countdown, of course. It always count down from 30 minutes. I wrote YAPT to serve a very narrow purpose. It's an egg timer to mark focused activities. 30 minutes makes sense for a focused activity. Besides, if you feel you can hold a focused state of mind more than the mere mortals can, then just fire it up again for another 30 minutes. 
2. Log each session. locally. Log the date, time of day. It will have a default label. You can override the default label if you want, but that is not necessary. It will save away anyway. 
3. Send the log file via email. There is only one log file. And there are only two things to do on the log file. 1) Erase it and 2) Send it via email.
4. Display only *Start and Pause* buttons
5. It will automatically pause when a call comes in
