Apache Tomcat is a very popular choice for beginning programmers when learning how to build JSP and Servlets. Many teachers, instructors and mentors favor this tool, and for good reasons. It has been the reference implementation of the Servlet specification for many years. Even now in the age of GlassFish, the JEE server from Oracle, Apache Tomcat continues to be a choice for many developers as they explore servlet and JSP programming. 

Tomcat is a servlet container, it is also a web server because it can handle static html pages like many web servers such as Apache or IIS. 

## TODO Setup

Download Apache Tomcat from the official site [tomcat.apache.org](http://tomcat.apache.org), choose the latest version. At the time of writing, the latest version was v8.0. 

Unzip or untar the binary installer anywhere in your workstation drive. It will be wise to install it in a location where you will not need elevated or admin privileges. Pick a location where you have read, write and execute privileges. When starting to learn how to work with Tomcat, it's best not to have administrative challenges. You will encounter plenty of admin restrictions later on when you start deploying your apps. But for now, keep it sweet and simple. The safest location will be somewhere in your home folder. In Windows this maybe `C:\Users\yourname`. In OSX and Linux it will be `~/`. 

## TODO Configuration

Let's say I will put the Tomcat installation on `~/progtools/`  

# TODO IDE Integration

## TODO Eclipse

## TODO Netbeans
