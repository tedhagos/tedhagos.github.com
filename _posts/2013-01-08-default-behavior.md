title: The Brain's Playbook
---

I know what I have to do, I've written (and rewritten) them down in the notebook, in the goal papers; yet I don't want to do them. There's a tug-of-war happening inside and the lazy guys seems to be winning. 

My primitive brain is taking over, it's telling me to do nothing, conserve energy (that means sleep) and eat (fast and plenty)&mdash;I know that if I take my eyes off the focus for the day, the lazy guy is gonna win. I have to shake this monkey off my back, I've got lots of things to do today&mdash;maybe a 15 minute cardio should perk me up again; or coffee, that can do the trick too; just don't put sugar in it because the lazy guy loves sugar.
