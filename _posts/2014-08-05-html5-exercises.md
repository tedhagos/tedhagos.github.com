**1. Resize the triangle**

Create a 500px wide HTML5 canvas that allows a user to increase/decrease the size of an equilateral triangle as shown in the picture. If the user clicks the small triangle pointing downward (labeled 1), the height of the triangle decreases by 5px. If the user clicks the small triangle pointing upwards (labeld 2), the height of the triangle increases by 5px.

**2. Move the circle** along the path of the arc

Animate the small circle. Make it move from left to right. Start at the left-most part of the arc and finish at the right-most end. The movement of the circle will trace the curve of the arc. The arc is a half circle. The canvas is 500px wide.

**3. Bouncing ball**



Animate the ball inside the bounded region. The ball travels in a straight path. When it hits a side of the bounding region, it will bounce (like in a pool table). The angle of deflection does not need to physically accurate, you can use an arbitrary angle for the deflection (e.g. 45 deg). The canvas size is 500px wide by 500px tall
