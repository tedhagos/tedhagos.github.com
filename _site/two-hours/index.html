		    <h1>The first two hours</h1>
		    <p>Wake up 2 hours earlier than your usual. After the morning rituals, coffee etc, don't turn on the computer, don't check your email, don't look at cell phone --- stay disconnected for the first two hours. Use the time to;</p>

<ol>
<li>Look at your todo list for the week</li>
<li>Look at your todo list yesterday</li>
<li>Write (rewrite) the todo list for the day. See which one of task list requires the 20% of effort and could give rise to 80% of the expected results for today. Be brutal about the selection. Those task that will not make the cut are probably less important anyway--Either delay it, queue it, delete it altogether</li>
</ol>


<p>The first two hours is important, it sets the tone of the day. If you don't set the tone, the hours will pass by and you will wander aimlessly; sure you will respond to emails, answer your phone, engage in conversations---but those are probably the 80% of your activity that gives rise to only 20% of your results (maybe even a lot less than 20%) --- do the important stuff first; the important ones for you, that is.</p>
