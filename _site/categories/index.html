  java<p>When you call someone over the phone, you can’t talk right away because the line is still ringing. You need to wait for the other person to pick up, you will then say hello, introduce yourself then the conversation can begin. The steps that are necessary to complete a phone call are carried out in a very serial way. Before the last step can begin, the step before that needs to complete first, so is the step before that and the step before it etc. Everything is in the critical path. If we wrote programs this way, we’d be in trouble. </p>

<p>Imagine that we have to write a program that accepts input from a user, that input will be used as a key to look up a value in a remote database. If we will write this program in a serial way, it is likely that the users of the program will complain at some point when the program becomes non-responsive. A database  operation can take a long time especially if it is on a remote location. </p>

<p>REWORD
When the user submits his query, our program will wait until the database completes its action before it can return control to our user interface. If </p>

<p>If the database query takes a long time to complete, and this is commonplace, the user interface will freeze because it is waiting for the database operation to return the control.
END REWORD</p>

<p>When an action has to wait for some other action to complete before it can begin, that other action is referred to as a <strong>blocking operation</strong> because it prevents the action that comes after it from starting.  </p>

<p>Consider the email workflow as a contrast to the telephone workflow. The send, receive, reply action between the two parties does not have any blocking restrictions. You can send the email and you don’t need to wait for it to be received, you can go about doing other things with your time. The send, receive and reply actions on the email are <strong>non-blocking</strong>. The email workflow might be a bad model to illustrate the non-blocking concept, but it gets the point across. The sender is free to do other things once the message has been sent.  </p>

<p>Java programs can be written in a non-blocking way by using <strong>Thread</strong> objects. The general idea is to group all the statements you don’t want to run independently, in a <strong>non-blocking</strong> way, inside a Thread object and let it run independently.  </p>

<p>main is a single thread</p>

<p>To set the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> variable on OSX, use the tool <code>/usr/libexec/java_home</code> on a terminal window. That command will echo where the current JDK is pointing to. You can copy the output  of that command from the clipboard with this command</p>

<p><code>$ /usr/libexec/java_home | pbcopy</code></p>

<p>then update the <strong>~/.bash_profile</strong> so you can export the JAVA_HOME variable. Tools like Apache Ant and Maven expects this variable to be present in order to locate the installed JDK on your system. Some IDEs like Android Studio also expects to find this variable defined somewhere in your system. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you can add this line to the <strong>/.bash_profile</strong></p>

<pre><code>export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="when-you-have-more-than-one-jdk-installed">When you have more than one JDK installed</h2>

<p>If you have JDK 1.5,1.6,1.7 and Java 8 installed on the Mac, <code>java_home</code> will point the most recent version of JDK you installed.  There used to be a way in OSX to switch JDKs, it was a utility called <strong>Java Preferences</strong>. It’s gone now. It has been gone for quite some time. If you want to see all the JDKs installed in your system, run this command</p>

<pre><code>$ /usr/libexec.java_home -V
</code></pre>

<p>You might be tempted to fool around with symlinks in order so switch between one version of the JDK to another. Don’t. It’s a bad idea, especially if you are not very handy with the SHELL. Use the <code>java_home</code> tool instead.</p>

<p>I found the script floating around on the internet while I was searching for a solution on how to safely switch from one version of the JDK to another.  </p>

<p>Programmers create things (data). We manipulate them by adding, substracting, dividing or multiplying. Sometimes we mash them up together (concatenation), then we create more things. Sometimes, we store these things for later use, and other times we don’t, we simply discard them. Sometimes we dig up things that we have stored in the past (retrieval) and other times we show the things we’ve tucked away to other people (reports). This is an oversimplification of what programmers do, but I would guess that it is not very far from it. </p>

<p>In order to create things, we need to know what kinds of things you can create. Will you be counting these things (whole numbers) or will you measure them (real numbers)? If we need to compare one thing to another thing, how will we  remember the result of that comparisson? Can we store the result of that comparisson inside another kind of thing, perhaps one that is aware of truth and falsity? </p>

<p>If we were using a language that is pretty close to the metal, like assembly, you may need to know quite a bit about how things are stored and organized in a very low-level fashion before you can get very far.  We are, however, using Java and it will not require us to work close to the metal. </p>

<p>You will work with <strong>types</strong> rather than bits (zeroes and ones). Java has defined some useful abstractions for us already. These abstractions allow us to work with relative ease because we can represent familiar concepts with ready-made <strong>types</strong>. For example, if you need to work with real numbers, Java has defined the <strong>float</strong> and <strong>double</strong>  data types. If you need to work with words and letters, Java has defined for us the <strong>java.lang.String</strong> type.  These abstractions are high enough that we don’t get bogged down by the details of how they are stored and structured on the disk, we can worry about other things like the logic of our application. </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>byte:</strong> signed 8-bit integer (-128 to 127)</li>
  <li><strong>short :</strong> signed 32-bit integer (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)</li>
  <li><strong>long:</strong> signed 64-bit integer (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,807)</li>
  <li><strong>float:</strong> signed 32-bit floating point (32 bit IEEE 754 floating point)</li>
  <li><strong>double:</strong> signed 64-bit floating point (64 bit IEEE 754 floating point)</li>
  <li><strong>char :</strong> 16-bit Unicode character (0 to 65535 or \u0000 to \uFFFF)</li>
  <li><strong>boolean:</strong> either <strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>

<p>Variables are created by declaring them, then defining them. For example, </p>

<pre><code>int i;
</code></pre>

<p>The code above is a statement that <strong>declares</strong> the variable named <strong>i</strong> that is of type <strong>int</strong> (integer). It does not <strong>define</strong> the value of i though.</p>

<pre><code>int i;
i = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>In the code sample above, the variable <strong>i</strong> was <strong>declared</strong> on one line and then <strong>defined</strong> on the following line. Declaration and definition of variables does not necessarily need 2 separate statements. The next sample code declares and defines a variable in one statement.</p>

<pre><code>int i = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>Why are we specifying that <strong>i</strong> is an int? That is because Java is a statically typed language. The compiler will not guess what kind of data you are creating, you have to tell it explicitly before it gets compiled. </p>

<h2 id="rules-on-types">Rules on types</h2>

<p>The numerical types of Java follows a certain hierarchy. A <strong>double</strong> type is bigger than a <strong>float</strong> which is bigger than a <strong>long</strong> which is bigger than an <strong>int</strong> which is bigger than a <strong>short</strong> which is bigger than a <strong>byte</strong>. It is best to keep this hierarchy in mind because we will be working with types quite a lot. There are times that we need to work with a combination of types in one statement. But for now, we need to remember that values of a smaller type can be assigned to a variable that has a larger type.</p>

<pre><code>int a = 10;
int b = a;
long c = b;
double d = c;
</code></pre>

<p>We can assign <strong>b to a</strong> because they are both integers. We can assign <strong>b to c</strong> because a long is bigger than an integer. And <strong>c to d</strong> because a double is bigger than a long. When you assign a value that is of a smaller type to one of a larger type, it is referred to as <strong>upcasting</strong>. Upcasting is automatically performed for you when you do operations like the one in the example above. </p>

<p>Let’s look at another example.</p>

<pre><code>byte a = 1;
byte b = 2;
byte c = a + b;
</code></pre>

<p>It looks innocent and deceitfully correct, but it will result to an error. It can be reasoned that because we added two byte values, <strong>a + b</strong>, we can assign the arithmetic result to variable <strong>c</strong>, which is declared as a byte. That would have been correct if the resulting type of adding two <strong>byte</strong> values is also a byte. That is not the case. One apple added to another another apple doesn’t make two apples in this case. It looks counter-intutive and scaringly frustrating to a beginning Java programmer. But the frustration, hopefully, should go away given a bit more practice and familiarity with the rules governing Java programming.</p>

<p>For the most part, we can work with variables of differing types e.g. add an int to a double, subtract a byte from an int etc, multiply a float with a long. But what kind of type will the resultant value have? To answer that, we will need to know another rule.</p>

<p>When a <strong>double</strong> is added to something smaller (float, long, int etc) the resulting type is a double. When a <strong>float</strong> is added to something smaller (long, int, short etc), the result is float. When a <strong>long</strong> added to either an <strong>int, short,  byte or char</strong>, the result is a long. For everything else the result of the operation is an <strong>int</strong>.</p>

<p>I simply chose the arithmetic <strong>add</strong> operation for the explanation for convenience. It is a lot easier to say (and write), but the rule holds up for subtraction, multiplication, division and even modulus. No arithmetic operation will ever result into <strong>short</strong> or <strong>byte</strong>. There is a very interesting reason for that rule, it sounds really clever too but that is out of the scope of this material. If you want to pursue that reason, dig up on “how Java does arithmetic internally”. </p>

<p>Let’s continue to work on our small byte addition example earlier, let’s fix that.</p>

<pre><code>class ByteAdd {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    byte a = 1;
    byte b = 2;
    int c = a + b;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And now, all is well. </p>

<h2 id="todo-reference-and-footnote-java-internal-arithmetic">TODO Reference and footnote Java internal arithmetic</h2>

<p>Look at the JLS</p>

<div id="footnotes">
<h2 class="footnotes">Footnotes: </h2>
<div id="text-footnotes">

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.1" name="fn.1" class="footnum" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> A statically typed language requires that that all variable types should be known before compilation. Static typing gives the compiler information about the data. This is why Java can prevent you from doing silly things like declaring a variable as String and then using them in an arithmetic operation which may not be appropriate for Strings.</div>


</div>
</div>
<p>Your ability to direct and command the flow of control in your program is one of the defining skills for a programmer. There are basically 3 ways that you can arrange the commands in your program code. You can execute commands one after another, <strong>sequencing</strong>.
You can execute certain commands when certain conditions are met, <strong>branching</strong>; and you can keep on repeating certain commands while certain conditions are still true, <strong>looping or iteration</strong></p>

<h2 id="if-statement">If statement</h2>

<pre><code>if(condition) {
  statement 1;
  statement 2;
  statement n;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>if</strong> statement allows you to conditionally perform some commands. It allows you side-step the main flow of your code. If you remember your flowcharting concepts or logic formumation. When you see the diamond shape, it means you have a fork in the road. When a condition is met, you either go left or right. That is what the <strong>if</strong> statement does. It allows you to test for conditions. When the condition is true, you go to the beginning of the if block (the opening curly brace) and begin executing all the statements there until all the statements are exhausted. When you have reached the end of the block (the closing curly brace), then there are no more commands to execute. The flow of control will resume immediately after the end of the curly brace. </p>

<p>The condition in the <strong>if</strong> statement can be written as expressions that will evaluate to either true or false. This is the most common use you will have of the if statement. On some occassions, you may see the condition written as the literals <strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong> – this is rare, but it will still be a legal code. Looks easy, right. </p>

<p>Okay, a little ice-breaker. Can you spot what’s wrong in the next code. Try not to read the explanation and figure it out yourself first.</p>

<pre><code>int i = 0;

if(i = 1) {
 System.out.println("but i is equal to one");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Did you catch it? If you did not, the Java compiler will. That’s a good thing. People with programming experience in <strong>C Language</strong> would be familiar with this, because the expression <code>if (i = 1)</code> would have been valid in <strong>C</strong>. Thankfully not in Java, the compiler would have warned you of “Incompatible type error”.</p>

<p>The <strong>**if</strong>** statement requires a boolean expession in the argument. The expression <code>(i = 1)</code> will not result to a boolean expression, rather it will yield a integer expression; zero if the operation succeeds and non-zero if it fails.</p>

<h2 id="nested-structures">Nested structures</h2>

<p>You can put an if statement inside another if statement. You can in fact nest them up pretty deeply. While there is no set limit on how deep you can nest if statements, practical considerations and code readability should knock some sense into your code. </p>

<p>From my experience, whenever I am treading dangerously deep into a web of if-else-if-else, that is usually a signal to take a step back and look if there are other ways of going about controlling program logic. It could be a design or analysis problem already and that using the if-else statement is not the right tool to solve the problem at hand. </p>

<h2 id="switch-statement">Switch statement</h2>

<p>When the nature of the decision you need to make is a bit on the fuzzy side, it could be impractical to use the if-statement, for those kinds of decisions, you will use the switch-statement.</p>

<p>The syntax of the switch statement is;</p>

<pre><code>switch(expression) {
  case CONSTANTEXPR:
  case ENUMCONSTANTNAME:
  default:
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where expression can either be a <strong>char, byte, short, int</strong>. It can also be <strong>Character, Byte, Short, Integer</strong> OR an <strong>enum</strong> type. By the way, Character is not the same as char, that wasn’t a typo. Character is a Java class which is a wrapper class for the char primitive. As of Java 7, you can now use String expressions on the <strong>switch</strong> statement</p>

<p>The following code sample  extracts the day-of-week value from a <strong>Calendar</strong> object. The day-of-week is returned as integer, which makes it perfect to filter using a <strong>switch</strong> statement rather than nested <strong>if</strong></p>

<pre><code>import java.util.Calendar;

class SwitchSample {

  public static void main(String args[]){

    Calendar now = Calendar.getInstance();
    int dow = now.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK);

    switch(dow) {
      case 0:
        System.out.println("Sunday");
        break;
      case 1:
        System.out.println("Monday");
        break;
      case 2:
        System.out.println("Tuesday");
        break;
      case 3:
        System.out.println("Wednesday");
        break;
      case 4:
        System.out.println("Thursday");
        break;
      case 5:
        System.out.println("Friday");
        break;
      case 6:
        System.out.println("Saturday");
        break;
      default:
        System.out.println("What the value really is = " + dow);
      }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The switch is really simple to use, just put the expression which you’d like to test as an argument to the switch statement, then have a series of case statements inside the switch body.</p>

<p>Each case statement corresponds to a value, if the value of the expression is equivalent to a case value, then instructions immediately right after the colon of the case statement will be executed/evaluated, in fact the rest of the statements will be evaluated, all the way down, until it gets to the last instruction at the bottom of the switch statement; that’s not what your intention might be; that is the reason why I put a break statement. Once a case statement evaluates to true, Java blindly executes all the statements after that case, it won’t even bother checking the other cases – so note this, and be careful.</p>

<h2 id="while-statement">While statement</h2>

<p>The while statement is used when you would like to perform some commands repeatedly, like in a loop. There is another statement in Java that does looping, that is the <strong>for</strong> statement.</p>

<p>The <strong>**while</strong>** and <strong>**for</strong>** loop may overlap at times because they have a similar function. For a beginner, it may not be quite obvious when to use one and not the other. The basic difference of the two statements though is that;</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use the while loop if you do not know how many times you need to loop</li>
  <li>Use the for loop if you actually know how many times you will need to go through the loop</li>
</ol>

<p>A while loop looks like the following</p>

<pre><code>while(condition) {
  statement 1;
  statement 2;
  statement n;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The condition is either a literal (the keywords true or false) or an expression that will evaluate to either true or false (boolean values).</p>

<p>The basic idea in a <strong>while</strong> loop is this</p>

<ol>
  <li>The condition is evaluated for the first time, if the condition is true or resolves to true, then;</li>
  <li>Perform statement 1, then;</li>
  <li>Perform statement 2, then;</li>
  <li>Perform statement n, then;</li>
  <li>The program detects that we are at the end of while block (the closing curly brace is the end of the while block)</li>
  <li>The program will loop back to the condition and re-evaluate it again, if it still true, then;</li>
  <li>Perform statement (again)</li>
  <li>rinse repeat until you get the end of the end of the block again and until you get to re-evaluate the condition (again).</li>
</ol>

<p>You will only drop off end of the while block if and when the condition evaluates to false. This is the reason it is best to remember that you need write code inside the while block that will make the condition false at some point in time, lest you end up in a perpetual loop.</p>

<pre><code>import static java.lang.System.out;

class While {
  public static void main (String [] args){
    
    boolean condition = true;
    int counter = 0;
    
    while(condition) {
      out.println(counter);
      counter = counter + 1;
      
      if(counter &gt;10) {
        condition = false;
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The sample code above shows the use of a while statement. Always remember to put something inside your while loop that will make the conditon false at some point in time. A perpetual loop can be very difficult for a beginning programmer to spot.</p>

<h2 id="for-statement">For statement</h2>

<pre><code>for(beginning value; ending value; step) {
  statement 1;
  statement 2;
  statement 3;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>for loop</strong> like the <strong>while</strong> allows you to iterate and perform a group of statements over and over again. The for loop though, allows for more control.  </p>

<p>A key concept in using the for loop is the automatic counter, the <strong>step</strong>. The code will perform all the statements inside the block for a finite and determined number of times.</p>

<p>Each time that the whole block is evaluated, the <strong>step</strong> value is incremented. The incremented step value is then compared to the <strong>ending value</strong>, and when the ending value is reached, the for loop will then terminate. The program control will fall over to first statement immediately after the for loop block. </p>

<pre><code>class for_sample {
  public static void main (String [] args) {
    for(int i=0; i&lt;=10;i++) {
      System.out.println(i);
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the preceding example, we print some numeric values from zero (0) to ten (10). This is the exact thing that our <strong>while</strong> example was doing earlier.  </p>

<h2 id="break-and-continue">Break and Continue</h2>

<p>The <strong>**break</strong>** and <strong>**continue</strong>** keywords disrupts program flow inside loops, whether the for-loop or while-loop. </p>

<pre><code>while(condition) {
  statement 1;
  statement 2;
  break;
  statement 3;
  statement 4;
}

statement 5;
statement n;
</code></pre>

<p>The break statement caused the program flow inside a block to forcibly exit. In the sample code (Fig 7), as soon as the break statement is encountered, the program control ignored statements 3 and 4. The while loop will go out of scope and program control will be transferred to the first executable statement immediately after the while block – in this case, statement 5.  </p>

<p>You normally will not use the break statement in this fashion because it doesn’t make sense. This statement is usually deployed with more logical finesse. </p>

<pre><code>while(condition) {
  statement 1;
  statement 2;

  if(someCondition) {
    break;
  } 

  statement 3;
  statement 4;
}

statement 5;
statement n;
</code></pre>

<p>This is a more likely use of the <strong>break</strong> statement. I should warn you though that this is a frowned upon practice. A truly structured programming should have only one entry point and one exit point. Because of the introduction the <strong>break</strong> statement, our control structure now has one entry point and two exit points.  </p>

<p>While this code is innocent enough right now, it could get very hairy and complicated. You will appreciate following the 1-entry-1-exit rule when you have had your fair share of debugging someone else’s code and you are wading through a maze of nested structures with lots of breaks peppered into the source code — and by then you will understand why nobody wants to work on a code they did not write themselves. </p>

<p>Next is the <strong>**continue</strong>** keyword. Here is how it behaves.</p>

<pre><code>while(condition) {
  statement 1;
  statement 2;
  continue;
  statement 3;
  statement 4;
}

statement 5;
statement n;
</code></pre>

<p>When the <strong>continue</strong> statement is encountered, statements 3 and 4 will be ignored, just like how it was with the break. Unlike the case in <strong>**break</strong>** though, the loop will not go out of scope and will not be immediately terminated.  </p>

<p>The <strong>continue</strong> statement will go back to the beginning of the loop and forcibly re-evaluate condition. If the condition is still true, then the loop continues normally.</p>
<p>You’ve already seen the <strong>println</strong> method previous. We used it before. It is one the easiest built-in functions to utilize. All one needs to do to print is to pass something as a parameter to the <strong>println</strong> method, and it will do the rest.  The println can handle a variety of data types. You don’t need to worry what kind of data to use, just throw it to println and let it do its work.  </p>

<p>No surprises here. You have seen this code many times before.  It prints “Line number one”, then adds new line before it prints out “Line number two” then adds another new line. </p>

<p>You can put expressions inside the println.  Like this</p>

<p><img src="../images/expressions-println.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>Expressions inside the println method will be evaluated first before it gets printed. Any expression that results to a value can be printed inside the println — whether it is arithmetic, logical or simply combining Strings. </p>

<p>The second line in the second example is worth pointing out.  The first plus sign after the enclosing double quote is not meant to perform an arithmetic addition — the second plus sign was meant to do that. The first plus sign was meant to perform String combination. </p>

<p>Once the arithmetic sum of 1 and 2 have been resolved, the result will be combined with the String “1 + 2 = “.  In Java, if you add a String to anything, anything at all, whether it be a native or reference type, it gets converted into a String type.  Hence, the quickest way to convert any number to String is to add an empty String to it.</p>

<h1 id="systemoutprint">System.out.print</h1>

<p>The <strong>println</strong> has a variant form called <strong>print</strong> — without the <strong>ln</strong>. It does basically the same thing but it does not add a new line to the output.  Try this one out.</p>

  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This sample prints “Line number oneLine number two”. It was mashed up.  This behavior can come in handy depending on what you are doing. If you need to print things without adding a new line or carriage return, use the <strong>print</strong> method, if you need the line feed then use <strong>println</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>*</strong></p>

<p>There are things you can embed on Strings that can alter the printing behavior. They are called escape sequences or escape characters.  The most common escape sequence you may encounter is the <strong>**\n</strong>**.  </p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Escape</span> <span class="o">{</span>

  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Escape characters are written as part of the String literal. These characters start with a back slash and they affect the way the String is printed. In the sample code above, the \n escape character will add a line feed or carriage return then it will resume printing on the next line. </p>

<h1 id="formatting-the-print">Formatting the print</h1>

<p>There might be times when you will need to use a combination of variables and String literals  during printing. Since we know that adding String to another data type produces a String, we can always write expressions like this.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with this technique except that it’s cumbersome and prone to error. You can almost get cross-eyed just looking at it and checking whether the the pairs of double quotes are correct.  Fortunately, there are other ways to handle printing. These are <strong>printf</strong> and <strong>format</strong>.  The <strong>printf</strong> and <strong>format</strong>  method are equivalent in functionality, you can use either of one them to replace <strong>println</strong> or <strong>print</strong>.</p>

<p>Printf behaves exactly the same as its brothers <strong>println</strong> and <strong>print</strong>. All of them can handle whatever variable, literal or expression you throw to them. They will simply send it to STDOUT (your terminal).  But there are two things that <strong>printf</strong> does exceptionally well. It can handle positional parameters and formatting.  </p>

<p>Printf lets you insert placeholders or format specifiers inside the String literal. These placeholders will be filled up by the actual values which are specified also inside the <strong>printf</strong> method.  In the example, <strong>**%d</strong>** is a placeholder. There were three of them because there were three variables also to the right of the String literal.  The first %d corresponds to the variable <strong>a</strong>. The second %d is for the variable <strong>b</strong> and the last %d corresponds to variable c.  </p>

<p>The format specifier we used  in the example was written as %d because it needed to handle <strong>int</strong> values.  If we wanted it to deal with another type of data, we would have used a different specifier.  You can format quite a few things with <strong>printf</strong>. It can deal with dates, </p>

<p>Maven can automate some of the tasks involved in setting up a development environment for a Java web project. While you could use some established archetypes of Maven, it can also be managed by using a very simple Maven project structure.</p>

<p>A Java web application requires a servlet container. There are many, but Apache Tomcat is probably the most common. A close second choice would probably Jetty, which is what we will use. Jetty is very lightweight, much lighter than Tomcat. </p>

<p>In this sample project, we won’t even have to download Jetty manually. We simply need to add it as a dependency on the POM file and Maven will do the rest. It will pull the Jetty files from the repositories and get it installed. We don’t even have to worry of updating our system path.</p>

<p>A  database is a store of information. Logically, it is place where you tuck away any data that you intend to retrieve or manipulate any time in the future. It is a durable storage. Any information that you store in  a database is guaranteed to be saved even if the application that created the data is no longer running. A database outlives your application. </p>

<p>All data will ultimately end up as a file. That is the physical destination of all data stores. These files can vary widely when it comes to their physical representation. The simplest one is a text file and the information is written in a way that humans can read it when they open the file using a basic text editor. It can also be very elaborate where you split the information across many files. These files may not be human readable. You will need some intervening software process in order for the information to make sense. Our current subject of discussion is the latter one. Most mainstream databases organize information using a software process. </p>

<h1 id="database-programs">Database programs</h1>

<p>There are many software packages that offer database management e.g. Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite, to name a few. Each one has characteristics that set it apart from the others. Their merits and differences are beyond the scope of the current discussion. For our purposes, we will use SQLite. </p>

<p>By far and thus far, the data types you have seen are called <strong>primitive types</strong>. The Java Type System has another kind of type. It is called <strong>reference types</strong>. Let’s defer the discussion for reference types at least until after we’ve gone through the OOP topic. </p>

<p>For now, what we need to remember is that, if it’s not primitive (double, float, long, int, short, byte, char or boolean) then it must be a reference type. It’ not all scary, some reference types are actually pretty to use, for example, the <strong>String</strong> type which you have been using all  along since the Hello World program.</p>

<pre><code>String a = "Hello";
String b = "World";
String c = a + b;
int d = 10;
String e = a + d; // attention here
</code></pre>

<p>I called your attention to the last line because I thought this might be a good opportunity to explain why the addition operator works for a String type, what happened to our rule before — when a <strong>double</strong> is added to something else it becomes a double.</p>

<p>First, let’s put an addendum to our rule. <strong>When something is added to a String</strong> the whole expression becomes a String. The String type rules them all.</p>
<p>This should not not be a long section. If you have programmed before using another language, chances are these operators are exactly the same thing in that other language that you used. So it’s a not a big deal. There is not much to see here and to be honest, quite boring. So in this section, we will simply list the operators that you can use in Java. No gotcha’s nor clever examples, just a list. </p>

<h2 id="arithmetic">Arithmetic</h2>

<p>The <strong>+ - * / and %</strong> functions as you might expect. They work on numbers, both real and integral — with the exception of the <strong>+</strong> which also works on <strong>Strings</strong> as you’ve seen earlier.</p>

<h2 id="comparisson">Comparisson</h2>

<p>The <strong>&gt; &gt;=  &lt; &lt;= and ==</strong> are read, more than, more than or equal to,less than and less than or equal to, respectively. You know how to use them, you don’t need me to explain.</p>

<h2 id="logical">Logical</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>&amp;</strong> This is the logical <strong>and</strong>. The expression will only be true if both operands are true</li>
  <li><strong>&amp;&amp;</strong> This is the short circuit <strong>and</strong>, more or less the same as the logical <strong>and</strong> but it’s short circuit. If the first operand is already false, it will not even bother testing the second operand, it will immediately return <strong>false</strong>, hence it’s name, short-circuit.</li>
  <li><strong>|</strong> This is the logical <strong>or</strong>. The expression will return true as long as one of the operand is <strong>true</strong></li>
  <li><strong>||</strong> This is the short-circuit <strong>or</strong>. It follows the same prinnciple as <strong>&amp;&amp;</strong> only it performs it on an <strong>or</strong> condition — can you figure it out? That’s your homework.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are other operators in Java, but we won’t list them here. It makes sense to tackle them when there is more context. So we will leave the discussions of these other operators like <code>++ and --</code> for later.</p>
<p>You already know what <strong>upcasting</strong> is, we discussed that not too long ago. Upcasting happens when you assign a narrow type to a wider type e.g. an <strong>int</strong> value assigned to a <strong>long</strong>. Java does for you automatically, no intervention needed. The opposite of <strong>upcasting</strong> is of course, well, <strong>downcasting</strong> — not very creative, I know, but it makes the two terms easier to remember. </p>

<p>Downcasting happens when you force a wider type into a narrow type e.g. try to assign an <strong>int</strong> to a <strong>byte</strong>, the compiler won’t let you. Unlike upcasting, downcasting is an explicit activity. It needs action from the programmer. </p>

<p>Let’s go back to the byte arithmetic example of Fig 4. We solved that by making variable <strong>c</strong> a int. We also could have solved that problem using downcasting.</p>

<pre><code>class ByteAdd {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    byte a = 1;
    byte b = 2;
    byte c = (byte)(a + b);
  }
}

<p>The cast operator is the pair of parentheses. We are forcing the value to the right of the cast operator, in this case <code>(a + b)</code> which is a <strong>int</strong> to become a <strong>byte</strong>. You have to group expression <strong>a + b</strong> because if you did not, only the value <strong>a</strong> would have been casted to a byte, then the addition operation would be performed (which results to an int) then it will be assigned to <strong>c</strong> — the cast operator has a higher precedence than the addition operation, that is why you need to group.</p>

<p>Apache Tomcat is a very popular choice for beginning programmers when learning how to build JSP and Servlets. Many teachers, instructors and mentors favor this tool, and for good reasons. It has been the reference implementation of the Servlet specification for many years. Even now in the age of GlassFish, the JEE server from Oracle, Apache Tomcat continues to be a choice for many developers as they explore servlet and JSP programming. </p>

<p>Tomcat is a servlet container, it is also a web server because it can handle static html pages like many web servers such as Apache or IIS. </p>

<h2 id="todo-setup">TODO Setup</h2>

<p>Download Apache Tomcat from the official site <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org">tomcat.apache.org</a>, choose the latest version. At the time of writing, the latest version was v8.0. </p>

<p>Unzip or untar the binary installer anywhere in your workstation drive. It will be wise to install it in a location where you will not need elevated or admin privileges. Pick a location where you have read, write and execute privileges. When starting to learn how to work with Tomcat, it’s best not to have administrative challenges. You will encounter plenty of admin restrictions later on when you start deploying your apps. But for now, keep it sweet and simple. The safest location will be somewhere in your home folder. In Windows this maybe <code>C:\Users\yourname</code>. In OSX and Linux it will be <code>~/</code>. </p>

<h2 id="todo-configuration">TODO Configuration</h2>

<p>Let’s say I will put the Tomcat installation on <code>~/progtools/</code>  </p>

<p>Derive new classes from existing ones. Build class hierarchies and leverage existing codes. It’s a cheap way to reuse codes, you don’t have to do anything, just extend</p>

<p><strong>What is it</strong></p>

<p>Inheritance is a language capability. It is a form of reuse — functionality reuse. Instead of copying and pasting code, which is also a form of reuse, you can intead extend an existing code and add or modify its behavior.</p>
<p>Overriding - run time polymorphism Oveloading - compile time polymorphism</p>

<p>Modularity is a big deal with modern languages. Some experts actually include this feature on the list of things a language must have before it can considered an OO language.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Download the installer from  <a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi">maven site</a></li>
  <li>Unzip or untar downloaded file, put it somewhere in your file system, preferably a location where you have read/write/execute permissions</li>
  <li>Update the SYSTEM PATH to include the folder where you unzipped the maven installation</li>
  <li>Make sure Maven is working on the command line. Get a terminal window and invoke the maven command — <code>mvn</code>. If you did not get a <em>bad command or filename</em> error, that’s a good sign.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="folder-structure">Folder structure</h2>

<p>Maven expects a folder structure for a project. You can choose not to follow what it expects, but that means you need to do some configuration on your own. If you prefer not to monkey around the config, follow Maven’s world view on directory structure unless you have a really compelling reason not to.</p>

<p>The next set of terminal commands prepares a basic Maven project</p>

<pre><code>
$ cd ~/
$ mkdir BasicProject
$ cd BasicProject
$ mkdir -p src/main/java
$ touch src/main/java/HelloWorld.java
$ touch pom.xml

</code></pre>

<h3 id="pom-file">POM file</h3>

<p>Maven expects a pom.xml file on the top level directory of the project. This xml file drives the behavior of the build. There are a couple of things that Maven expects to find inside the pom file. It expects to find the modelVersion, groupId, artifactId and the version.</p>

<p>The pom file, short for Project Object Model, is an xml file. It contains information and configuration details about the project. Maven uses these details to do the build.</p>

<p>A simple POM file is shown below.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span class="nt">&lt;project&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;modelVersion&gt;</span>4.0.0<span class="nt">&lt;/modelVersion&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;groupId&gt;</span>com.hagos<span class="nt">&lt;/groupId&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;artifactId&gt;</span>HelloWorld<span class="nt">&lt;/artifactId&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;version&gt;</span>1.0-SNAPSHOT<span class="nt">&lt;/version&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;packaging&gt;</span>jar<span class="nt">&lt;/packaging&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/project&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The <strong>modelVersion</strong> is always set to 4.0 because it is currently the only supported model for Maven versions 2 and 3. This may change in the future. If Maven 4 comes out and there is another model, you should use the prescribed model and update the modelVersion value appropriately. Where can you find the modelVersion value? The <a href="https://maven.apache.org/pom.html">maven site</a> of course. </p>

<p>The <strong>groupId</strong> element is the same as the package name, it is that reverse domain name convention you use to organize your java source files, so just use that. The <strong>version</strong> element is self explanatory, you get to choose that. It simply indicates what version your application is already in.</p>

<h3 id="test">Test</h3>

<p>Create a rudimentary HelloWorld.java source file and save it in <strong>/src/main/java</strong> folder then try to compile the project. On a terminal window, make sure you are at the top level directory of the <em>BasicProject</em> folder, run the command</p>

<p><code>mvn compile</code></p>

<p>This will compile the project. There is only one source file in the project so far so it may not seem to be a big deal right now. A build tools like Maven shines better when working with multi file projects. </p>

<p>All the compiled codes will be placed in the <strong><em>target/classes</em></strong> folder. Those were created by Maven during compilation. The BasicProject folder should now resemble the following</p>

<pre><code>.
├── pom.xml
├── src
│   └── main
│       └── java
│           └── HelloWorld.java
└── target
    └── classes
        └── com
            └── hagos
                └── HelloWorld.class
</code></pre>

<h3 id="running-the-application">Running the application</h3>

<p>On the same terminal window that you have been using, cd to the target/classes folder then run the Java app</p>

<p><code>cd target/classes</code><br />
<code>java com.hagos.HelloWorld</code></p>

<h2 id="java-execute">Java Execute</h2>

<p>Maven can do lots of stuff via plugins. One of the things it can do is to execute a Java app from maven. It’s not a big deal to cd to target/classes then run the Java app from there. But if you do this lots of times in a day, that can get annoying. </p>

<h3 id="maven-exec-plugin">Maven Exec Plugin</h3>

<p>To make maven run your programs, you need to get the mvn-exec plugin. Using this plugin in your app requires not much else than declaring the plugin in the POM file. Add the plugin in the build section. </p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span class="nt">&lt;project&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;modelVersion&gt;</span>4.0.0<span class="nt">&lt;/modelVersion&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;groupId&gt;</span>com.hagos<span class="nt">&lt;/groupId&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;artifactId&gt;</span>HelloWorld<span class="nt">&lt;/artifactId&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;version&gt;</span>1.0-SNAPSHOT<span class="nt">&lt;/version&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;packaging&gt;</span>jar<span class="nt">&lt;/packaging&gt;</span>

  <span class="nt">&lt;build&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;plugins&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;plugin&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;groupId&gt;</span>org.codehaus.mojo<span class="nt">&lt;/groupId&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;artifactId&gt;</span>exec-maven-plugin<span class="nt">&lt;/artifactId&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;version&gt;</span>1.2.1<span class="nt">&lt;/version&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;/plugin&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/plugins&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/build&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/project&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The build node of the POM contains the plugins node. Each plugin, like the mvn-exec, needs to be inside the plugins node. </p>

<p>Now you can do the following command</p>

<p><code>mvn compile</code><br />
<code>mvn exec:java -DmainClass=com.hagos.HelloWorld</code></p>

<p>If you want to get rid of that pesky -D argument, you can declare the main class inside the POM file.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span class="nt">&lt;plugin&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;groupId&gt;</span>org.codehaus.mojo<span class="nt">&lt;/groupId&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;artifactId&gt;</span>exec-maven-plugin<span class="nt">&lt;/artifactId&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;version&gt;</span>1.2.1<span class="nt">&lt;/version&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;configuration&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;mainClass&gt;</span>com.hagos.HelloWorld<span class="nt">&lt;/mainClass&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/configuration&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/plugin&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Now that maven knows what the main class is, there is no need to pass the -D argument when you want to execute the Java app from maven</p>

<p><code>mvn compile</code><br />
<code>mvn exec:java</code>  </p>

<h2 id="review-of-the-maven-commands">Review of the maven commands</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>mvn compile:</strong> compiles a maven project</li>
  <li><strong>mvn clean:</strong> removes the target folder and all of its contentes. It will remove also any jar file packages that may have been created</li>
  <li><strong>mvn package:</strong> creates a jar package if you specified <em>packaging</em> in the POM file</li>
  <li><strong>mvn exec:java:</strong> executes a Java app, you need to pass the -DmainClass argument for this command, or you can configure the mainClass in the POM file</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="forgetting-the-semicolon">Forgetting the semicolon</h1>

<p>The Java compiler ignores white space. The only way for it to know that your statement is complete or finished is if you put tample   <br />
int i = 0
xi = i + 10;
\#+end_example  </p>

<p>The first line was supposed to be complete at the assignment of the literal value zero to i, but because you did not properly terminate it, the compiler thinks the statement reads this way</p>

<pre><code>int i = 0 i = i = 10;
</code></pre>

<p>Which of course doesn’t make sense. These kinds of errors are easy enough to spot when Java spits out a compilation error, but it may not always be as simple as this. Some IDEs may even help you out to quickly spot mistakes such as this one.</p>

<h1 id="running-the-byte-code">Running the byte code</h1>

<p><code>java Hello.class</code> </p>

<p>Results to <em>NoClassDefFoundError</em>. Just drop the <em>.class</em> extension when you run java programs, like this</p>

<p><code>java Hello</code></p>

<h1 id="running-a-class-without-a-main-method">Running a class without a main method</h1>

<p>Java, like most other languages requires an entry point to properly run. So if you define a class like this and then try to run it, it will compile but will not run</p>

<pre><code>// Hello.java
class Hello {

}
</code></pre>

<p><code>javac Hello.java</code><br />
<code>java Hello</code></p>

<p>The Java runtime will point it out to you, so it’s easy to spot this error. What’s not easy to spot are mispellings on the <em>main</em> method</p>

<pre><code>public static void Main(String args[]) // wrong 
public static void Main() // wrong
public static void main() // wrong
public static void main(String args) // wrong
</code></pre>

<p>All the examples above will compile, but won’t run. They all define a method called either <em>Main</em> or <em>main</em> but none of them complied with the prescribed signature for a Java entry point. The Java main needs to meet the following conditions</p>

<ol>
  <li>publicly accessible, hence the keyword <em>public</em>. It means other classes can call it from any package</li>
  <li>statically scoped, hence the <em>static</em> keyword. It means there is no need to create an instance of the enclosing class in order to invoke the method. The method belongs to the class and not its instance</li>
  <li>It does not return anything, hence the <em>void</em> keyword</li>
  <li>It accepts an array of java.lang.String type.</li>
</ol>

<p>A prooper main is written like this</p>

<pre><code>class Hello {
  public static void main(String args[]) {

  }
}
</code></pre>

<h1 id="comparing-strings">Comparing Strings</h1>

<pre><code>// filename: xCompareString.java

class CompareString {
  public static void main(String []args) {
    String a = "abc";
    String b = "abc";
    
    if(a == b) {System.out.println("a == b");}
    else {System.out.println("a &lt;&gt; b");}

  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>There are two kinds of data values in Java. The first kind is the primitive data type. Java defines eight of them — <em>byte, short, int, long, char, float, double</em> and <em>boolean</em>. Use the double equal operator to determine equality for these types. The other kind of data in Java is the reference type. Reference types are objects. String is a reference type. </p>

<p>The example ab ove is a tricky one because the expression <code>(a == b)</code> will actually evaluate to true. But that only happened because of Java has a concept of a String literal pool . The variables <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> truly are pointing to exactly the same instance of “abc” in the pool. </p>

<p>Comparisson of one String to another — or for that matter, one reference type to another — use the <em>.equals()</em> method. </p>

<pre><code>// filename: CompareString.java

class CompareString {
  public static void main(String []args) {
    String a = "abc";
    String b = "abc";
    
    if(a.equals(b)) {System.out.println("a == b");}
    else {System.out.println("a &lt;&gt; b");}

  }
}
</code></pre>

<h1 id="arrays-start-with-zero-not-one">Arrays start with zero, not one</h1>

<pre><code>String basket[] = {"apple", "orange", "banana"};

basket[0] -&gt; "apple"
basket[1] -&gt; "orange"
basket[2] -&gt; "banana"
</code></pre>

<p>So if you get the length of array, it will be <em>3</em>, naturally, because it has 3 elements. But there is no <code>basket[3]</code> because the first element of the array numbered as zero, not 1. If you try to access <code>basket[3]</code>, you will see the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. </p>

<p>This thinng will bite when constructing loops that are intended to “walk” through the array, like this example below</p>

<pre><code>class ZeroBase {
  public static void main(String []args) {
    String basket[] = {"apple","orange","banana"};
    for(int i=0;i &lt;= basket.length; i++) {
      System.out.println(basket[i]);
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will compile, but will run into problems during execution. Just remember that the last element of the array is numbered as <code>basket.length -1</code>, always account for the fact that it starts with zero. So, to fix the code sample above, just rewrite the for loop to read either</p>

<pre><code>for(int i=0;i &lt; basket.length; i++)
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>for(int i=0;i &lt;= (basket.length - 1); i++)
</code></pre>

<p>Encapsulation combine behavior (method) and data (variables or states) into one. The atomic unit of code in Java is the class. You cannot write anything smaller than that. That is why even if you just want to print Hello World, you have to enclose it in a class.</p>

<p>There are things that happen inside a Java object from the time you create it using <strong>new</strong> up until you call its first method. The Java runtime makes certain calls to specific blocks of code in your class definition.</p>

<p>A Java object goes through several stages before you can call any of its instance methods. The static initializer kicks in first, if one is defined. And after that, the instance initializer and  then the constructor kicks in. The code below illustrates the construction of such initializers. </p>

  javascript<h1 id="objects">Objects</h1>

<p>There are many other programming languages which use objects. JavaScript isn’t even the first language to do it. The concept of managing complexity using objects as abstraction mechanism has been going on for quite some time. </p>

<p>What is it really</p>

<p>Well, it’s a way to manage complexity. But then I should make a case for complexity. What is complexity in software and how does objects abstraction address those. What kinds of problems does OOP solve</p>

<h1 id="complexity">Complexity</h1>

<h1 id="abstraction">Abstraction</h1>
<p><strong>1. Resize the triangle</strong></p>

<p>Create a 500px wide HTML5 canvas that allows a user to increase/decrease the size of an equilateral triangle as shown in the picture. If the user clicks the small triangle pointing downward (labeled 1), the height of the triangle decreases by 5px. If the user clicks the small triangle pointing upwards (labeld 2), the height of the triangle increases by 5px.</p>

<p><a href="/images/triangle-exam.png">See the picture</a></p>

<p><strong>2. Move the circle</strong> along the path of the arc</p>

<p>Animate the small circle. Make it move from left to right. Start at the left-most part of the arc and finish at the right-most end. The movement of the circle will trace the curve of the arc. The arc is a half circle. The canvas is 500px wide.</p>

<p><a href="/images/arc-exam.png">See the picture</a> </p>

<p><strong>3. Bouncing ball</strong></p>

<p>Animate the ball inside the bounded region. The ball travels in a straight path. When it hits a side of the bounding region, it will bounce (like in a pool table). The angle of deflection does not need to physically accurate, you can use an arbitrary angle for the deflection (e.g. 45 deg). The canvas size is 500px wide by 500px tall</p>

<p><a href="/images/bounce-exam.png">See the picture</a> </p>
<p>The JavaScript interpreter looks for the first statement in a program or script. It will read and execute that. If there is another statement after the first one, it will execute that too. It will keep on doing this until there are no more statments to execute. Think of program flow like a river or stream. It flows in one direction unless something alters that direction.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the interpreter encounters an instruction that will divert the flow of execution. These instructions are called control structures. Some structures allows you to branch and some structures allows for looping.</p>

<p>Branching happens when you divert program flow away from a linear path. Some instructions on the script are skipped or not performed when some conditions are true (or not). Branching is facilitated in JavaScript by using the keywords <strong>if</strong> and <strong>switch</strong>.</p>

<p>Looping happens when you perform statements repeatedly. This kind of control flow can be done by using the keywords <strong>while</strong> and <strong>for</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="todo-reword-the-prose-is-weak">TODO Reword. The prose is weak</h1>

<h1 id="if-statement">If statement</h1>

<p>Branching statements allows you to side step some statements when some conditions are true; <strong>if-else</strong> statement is one way to branch. When the expression inside the <strong>if()</strong> construct yields true, the statement inside the if block is executed. </p>

<p>The <strong>if</strong> statement can be used when you want to conditionally skip some statements. It forks the program flow. The basic construction of an <strong>if</strong> statement is as follows</p>

<pre><code>if (&lt;boolean expresion&gt;) {
  // statements;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The boolean expression (condition) is an argument to the <strong>if</strong> reserved word. It needs to evaluate to either true or false. The pair of curly braces is optional. If you only have one statement to execute when the condition is true, the braces can be omitted. </p>

<span class="c1">// RETURNS nah!</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Be careful when writing your comparisson operator. Here’s a slightly modified version of the code above</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="p">}</span> 

<span class="c1">// RETURNS true</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Can you spot the difference? The expression inside the if() construct is improperly written as an assignment rather than a test for equality–but JavaScript went to evaluate it anyway. Be careful with this one because this mistake is so easy to make. The reason this returned <strong>**true</strong>** is because an arithmetic assignment operation returns the zero value, and if you use a number where a boolean expression is expected, the number is convered to the <strong>true</strong> value. </p>

<h1 id="switch-statement">Switch statement</h1>

<p>is another way of branching. It is a bit more concise than the if-else statement, it allows for a different kind of construction. </p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;hello&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="c1">// RETURNS &quot;Hello&quot;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The values listed in <strong>case</strong> statements can be Strings, booleans or numbers (a bit of a relief if you are coming the Java language where the case is restricted to integer values). Always add the <strong>break</strong> keyword inside the case statement lest you will have unintended consequences–without the break keyword, the program will overflow to the remaining statements of the <strong>switch construct</strong> even if a match has already been found. </p>

<h1 id="while-loop">While loop</h1>

<p>Looping or iteration statements allows you to perform some statements repeatedly while some conditions are true.</p>

<p>The <strong>while</strong> statement is a looping mechanism. It requires a boolean value (or an expression that yields a boolean value) inside the <strong>**while()</strong>** construct. The statements inside the while block will be executed repeatedly as long as the expression inside while() is true. When the expression is no longer true, the loop terminates. </p>

<pre><code>var timetoexit = false;
var counter = 0;

while (!timetoexit) {
  console.log("counter = " + counter);
  if (counter++ == 10) timetoexit = true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can use the <strong>break</strong> keyword to break out of loops, like this</p>

<pre><code>var timetoexit = false;
var counter = 0;

while (!timetoexit) {
  console.log("counter = " + counter);
  if (counter++ == 10) break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The break keyword causes the program flow to ignore all the statements (if there are any) immediately following the <strong>break</strong> keyword and fall right outside the end of the while block where the program flow will resume.  </p>

<p>Another keyword related to loop structures is the <strong>**continue</strong>** keyword. It causes program flow to jump also</p>

<pre><code>var timetoexit = false;
var counter = 0;

while (!timetoexit) {

  console.log("counter = " + counter);
  if (++counter == 10) {
    timetoexit = true;
    continue; 
  }
  console.log("*");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Unlike <strong>break</strong> though, <strong>**continue</strong>** causes program flow to ignore all the remaining statements until the end of the while block and jump right away to the beginning of the while loop—forcing the condition to get re-evaluated; this is the reason why our last asterisk never got printed. </p>

<h1 id="for-loop">For loop</h1>

<p>The <strong>for</strong> statement is another looping mechanism. The for loop like the while loop allows you to iterate and perform a group of statements over and over again. </p>

<pre><code>for ([where to begin] ; [where to stop] ; [step]) {

}
</code></pre>

<p>A key concept in using the for loop is the counter (the step). Loop will perform all the statements inside the block for a finite and determined number of times. Each time that the whole block is evaluated, the step value is incremented. The incremented step value is then compared to the ending value, and when the ending value is reached, the for loop will then terminate. The program control will fall over to first statement immediately after the for loop block.</p>

<pre><code>for (i = 1 ; i &lt; 10 ; i++) {

  console.log(i);

}
</code></pre>

<p>The code sample above defines the starting point at 1 (i = 1), it will stop the loop execution when <strong>i &lt; 10</strong>.  Each time the <strong>for</strong> loop is evaluated, the i variable will be incremented by 1 (i++).</p>

<p>Here is a another sample of the for loop.</p>

<pre><code>var util = require('util')

var i = 1;
var j = 1;

for (i = 1 ; i &lt; 10; i++) {

    for (j =1 ; j &lt; 10; j++) {

        util.print(i * j + "\t");

    }

    util.print("\n");
}

  emacs<h1 id="setup">Setup</h1>

<p>Emacs is fairly ubiquitous already. It has been around for a long time so you can pretty much get it no matter what your choice of platform is. But it is pretty at home with UNIXes and the Linuxes. </p>

<p>For Linux, the <code>sudo-apt-get install emacs-nox</code> should do it. This will work for Debian and Debian-ish platforms. I haven’t used RedHat or it’s derivatives for a while now but you may have to use their <code>yum</code>  package manager. I specified <em>emacs-nox</em> because I don’t want to install the GTK or X11 version of emacs – <em>nox</em> means “no x windows”. </p>

<p>In OSX, the  <code>brew install emacs</code> is what you will use if you use the <em>HomeBrew</em> package manager. You can use macports of Fink if that is what you use as a package manager.</p>

<p>Windows users can download the binary distributions from the <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/">Emacs site</a>.</p>

<p>In OSX, you need to a little bit more setup because OSX comes with an outdated version of GNU emacs, so you may have to delete that first and then do something inside <code>/usr/bin/</code> </p>

<p><code>$ sudo rm /usr/bin/emacs</code><br />
<code>$ sudo rm -fvr /usr/share/emacs</code><br />
<code>$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/emacs /usr/bin/emacs</code>  </p>

<p>You can now launch emacs from any terminal window. </p>

<h1 id="configuration-and-startup-files">Configuration and Startup files</h1>

<p>Generally, emacs reads the files ~/.emacs and ~/.emacs.d/init.el. This is where you can write your startup settings e.g. setting of color theme, treatment of line wraps, how to treat tabs (or spaces) etc. </p>

<p>Emacs uses lisp, actually a specific kind of lisp called <em>elisp</em> which stands for emacs lisp. This the language you will use if you want to monkey around emacs and bend it to submission. Don’t worry too much if you don’t know much about lisp or don’t know it all. The emacs community is large. There is no shortage of blog post and Gists which features ready made emacs init files that you can mindlessly cut and paste into your own.</p>

<p>If your needs are simple, e.g. convert the tabs to spaces, set the number of spaces for a tab, write source codes using the K &amp; R convention, write your diary and convert it to HTML, a quick Google search about these things will usually do the fix for you. There are pretty standard ways of accomplishing these things in the emacs init files.</p>

<h1 id="opening-and-closing-files">Opening and Closing files</h1>

<p>After you launched emacs, you can open a file by pressing <code>C x C f</code> that means, press the control key, press <code>x</code>, don’t let go of the control key, and press <code>f</code>. Emacs will wait for you to input a name of the file. Pay attention to input area in the lower left of the emacs window. You will type the name of the file and it’s path in there. </p>

<p><img src="../images/emacs-find-file.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>You can close the file by using the command <code>C x C c</code> that means press <code>CTRL x</code> but don’t let the CTRL key go. While the CTRL is still depressed, press <code>s</code>. That will save the file. If you want to save the file using another name (Save As), the command is <code>C x C w</code>.</p>

<p><code>C x C c</code> will exit emacs. In case you have unsaved work, emacs won’t let you leave without confirming your action. It will nag you whether you want to save any unsaved work etc. </p>

<h1 id="packages">Packages</h1>

<p>Emacs has a lively community of users and contributors. If there is a functionality you need and it’s not built-in with emacs, chances are somebody built a package for that. So you need to know how to get additional software for emacs. </p>

<p>Software packages for emacs are lisp files. They have the extension <em>.el</em> and there are plenty of sources for that. The more popular sources <a href="http://elpa.gnu.org/packages">elpa</a>, <a href="http://marmalade-repo.org/packages">marmalade</a> and <a href="http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/">melpa</a> . There are others but these three seems to be favorites. </p>

<p>To use these software sources, you need to tell emacs about their existence. That is done via the init files. So if you already have installed emacs, go ahead and use it for edit your init files. You can follow these steps.</p>

<p><code>$ touch ~/.emacs</code><br />
<code>$ emacs ~/.emacs</code>  </p>

<p>Once emacs has opened the <em>.emacs</em> init file, put the following codes inside</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-lisp" data-lang="lisp"><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">package-archives</span> <span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="s">&quot;gnu&quot;</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="s">&quot;http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
                         <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;marmalade&quot;</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="s">&quot;http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
                         <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;melpa&quot;</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="s">&quot;http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/&quot;</span><span class="p">)))</span></code></pre></div>

<p>These settings and URL values were lifted straight from the <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ELPA">EmacsWiki</a> site. There are other ways of configuring the package manager on that site, you should go visit that page. </p>

<p>Save the file by pressing <code>CTRL + x</code> don’t let the CTRL key go, keep it pressed, then press <code>s</code>. In emacs lingo, you will see this command written as <code>C - x C - s</code>. The C stands for the CTRL key. So remember that when you see this notation, it means press CTRL key then press <code>x</code> after that press <code>s</code> without letting go of the CTRL key. That command saves the contents of your current buffer to the file <em>~</em>.emacs/. </p>

<p>You have to exit your emacs session and start it over again. The restart is necessary because emacs needs to read the new entries on it’s init file. To exit emacs, press <code>C - x C - c</code>. You already know what that notation means. That is the command to exit emacs. </p>

<p>Now start emacs again and then press <code>ESC - x</code>, you can also press <code>ALT - x</code>, it will yield the same result. Pay attention to message window on left lower portion of emacs, it says <strong>M - x</strong>. It’s waiting for you to type something. It’s waiting for a command. Now type <code>list-packages</code> RET (RET means return key or entery key). It might take a little while because emacs is communicating with online repositories. It’s grabbing a list of available software which it will show you onscreen in a little while. </p>

<p>Take the time to browse through them, if something catches your fancy, go ahead and position the cursor on that list entry then press <code>i</code>, that means mark it for installation. Then press <code>x</code> to install what was marked. </p>

<p>When you are all done. Press <code>q</code> to quit the screen which lists the software packages. </p>

<h1 id="java-coding">Java Coding</h1>

<p>You need to define a <em>hook</em> when emacs enters Java mode — when it opens a <em>.java</em> source file. Then set theh appropriate variables inside the hook
1.  Use spaces in place of tabs – <code>indent-tabs-mode nil</code>
2.  Use 2 spaces for indenting code – <code>c-basic-offset 2</code>
3.  Use the Kernighan &amp; Ritchie convention for aligning the curly braces – <code>c-default-style k&amp;r</code></p>

<p>Below is the copy-pastable setting that you can plunk in the <em>.emacs</em> init file</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-lisp" data-lang="lisp"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">&#39;java-mode-hook</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="s">&quot; Treat JDK 1.5 annotations as comments&quot;</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">c-comment-start-regexp</span> <span class="s">&quot;(@|/(/|[*][*]?))&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">modify-syntax-entry</span> <span class="nv">?@</span> <span class="s">&quot;&lt;b&quot;</span> <span class="nv">java-mode-syntax-table</span><span class="p">)))</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">&#39;java-mode-hook</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">c-default-style</span> <span class="s">&quot;k&amp;r&quot;</span> <span class="nv">c-basic-offset</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="nv">tab-width</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="nv">indent-tabs-mode</span> <span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">)))</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The <em>c-default-style k&amp;r</em> means it will use the curly braces alignment of Kernighan and
Ritchie, the opening curly brace is at the right most side, immediately following the
closing parens and the closing curly brace is flushed at the left side. </p>

<p>The K &amp; R style isn’t the only one you can use. The other indenting styles are well documented in EmacsWiki/Indenting Cand on WikiPedia/IndentStyle</p>

<h1 id="text-expansion-autocorrection">Text expansion, AutoCorrection</h1>

<p><code>(setq save abbrevs nil)</code><br />
<code>(setq-default abbrev-mode t)</code><br />
<code>(load "~/.emacs.d/abbrev_defs")</code></p>

<h1 id="note-taking-with-org">Note taking with org</h1>

<p>You must download org-mode using the package manager (package.el), get org-mode from there either from elpa, melpa or marmalade</p>

<p>To publish in HTML, M-x org-html-export-to-html, that’s it or you might want to look at this 
<a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-publish-html-tutorial.html">http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-publish-html-tutorial.html</a></p>

<h1 id="color-problem-with-tmux">Color problem with tmux</h1>

<p>TMUX messes with the color scheme that is setup in emacs. You need to fix the color scheme in tmux. There are plenty of ways to do this. I would think there is a way in .tmux.conf, the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/tmux">TMUX section of ArchWiki</a> has some detailed advice on this one. Or you can simply pass the TERM value when you start tmux. In the <em>.bashrc</em> or or <em>.bash_profile</em> add an alias to tmux</p>

<pre><code>alias tmux="TERM=screen-256color-bce tmux"
</code></pre>

<p>Now open tmux as you normally would e.g. <code>tmux new -s coding</code> then open emacs. TMUX shouldn’t be messing around with the emacs color-scheme now.</p>

<p>Another route you can try is to customise the <code>frame-background-mode</code> variable. Try the three different settings (0 = light, 1 = dark and 2 = automatic). Invoke the customise variable command <code>M x customize-variable RET</code> then type <code>frame-background-mode RET</code>. You will see the following screen.</p>

<p><img src="../images/frame-background-mode.png" alt="img" /> </p>

<p>Go to value menu, the RET. Choose either 0,1 or 2. Then go to the State menu and choose from one of the options. You can set the value of background just for the current session or you can choose to save it for future sessions. </p>

<p><code>M x org-version</code> shows 7.x.x when you expect it to be 8.x. This is a version conflict problem. This happened to my installation when I copied an .emacs init file, with ‘org’ references to it, and used it to load up a fresh install of emacs. Once I grabbed the org package from elpa, it resulted into tons of errors. </p>

<p>The solution is to do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Remove the org folder inside ~/.emacs.d/elpa</li>
  <li>Edit the ~/.emacs init files, remove any references to ‘org’</li>
  <li>Load up emacs using the clean .emacs init file</li>
  <li>Reinstall org from either elpa or orgmode source</li>
  <li>Exit and restart emacs. That solved the problem</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="use-elpa-or-org-mode-packages">Use elpa or org-mode packages</h1>

<p>Emacs 24.x use the GNU elpa repositories, so if you issue the command <code>M x list-packages</code>, you will see all the available (and installed) packages in Emacs. You need to be connected to the internet when you do this. Emacs will make a connection to elpa repository and grab a list of available software packages. </p>

<p>Since you already know that you want to install <em>org</em>, you can take a shorter route to the installation by issuing the command <code>M x package install RET org RET</code>. Wait for a while because that package will be grabbed from elpa and will be compiled afterwards.</p>

<p>Exit emacs, <code>C x C c</code> and restart it. You should now have the org package. You can check which version of org has been installed using the command <code>M x org-version RET</code>. You might see something similar to </p>

<pre><code>Org-mode version 8.2.6 (8.2.6-22-gb11b4a-elpa @ /home/thagos/.emacs.d/elpa/org-20140519/)/
</code></pre>

<h1 id="problems-with-version">Problems with version</h1>

<p>Sometimes you expect your version of org to be one thing, and then see another e.g., I expected my verion of org to be <code>8.x</code> but right after I grabbed org from the repos, it still showed 7.x. It appeared to be reverting back to the version of org built-in within Emacs. A telling sign that there was a problem on installation was that it showed errors during the compilation of the <code>org</code> package. It’s okay to see warnings, but not compilation errors. To solve this, follow the steps below.
1.  Exit emacs
2.  Sanitize the init files <em>~.emacs</em> or <em>~</em>.emacs.d/init.el/. Make sure there isn’t any reference to <em>org</em> in the startup up files
3.  Remove the <em>org</em> directories inside ~/.emacs.d/elpa/ folder.
4.  Start emacs using the sanitized init files
5.  Install the package again using <code>M x package-install RET org</code></p>

<p>The compilation errors should disappear and you should have an updated version of org</p>

<p>Org uses timestamps to trigger publishing. That means it won’t republish documents that have not changed. To override this behavior, you need to change the default behavior of Org when publishing. One way to do this is to customize the variable <em>org-publish-use-timestamps-flag</em>. This can be done within an emacs session. You can also achieve the same result by adding an entry to the the emacs init file, this could be the the ~/.emacs file. Add this entry </p>

<pre><code>(setq org-publish-use-timestamps-flag nil)
</code></pre>

<p>When this variable is set to <em>nil</em>, org will republish all of the files defined inside org-publish-project-alist.</p>
<p>Org can export the postamble to HTML, the default postamble exports the author name, date of creation, creator information (which shows the Org and Emacs version) and a link to validate the XHTML document. It usually is at the foot part of generated html document. </p>

<p>The default postamble can be overidden by specifying a value of postamble. Org exports certain variables which you can override and customize to your liking. The variable <code>org-html-postamble</code> is exported. </p>

<h1 id="inspecting-the-current-value-of-the-postamble">Inspecting the current value of the postamble</h1>

<p>Before you monkey around the postamble value, you might want to check the original/default values of the postamble, even just reference purposes. You can inspect the current value of the postamble by issuing the command</p>

<p><code>C h v org-html-postamble RET</code></p>

<p>Shows the current value of the postamble. </p>

<p><code>C h v org-html-postamble-format RET</code></p>

<p>Tells you a bit more information of what you can put inside the postamble. Below is excerpt from that last command</p>

<p>One way to set the postamble is to set the value of <code>org-html-postamble</code> in the init files, e.g. <em>~</em>.emacs/. You can add the following line</p>

<pre><code>(setq org-html-postamble "whatever you want, make sure its html though")
</code></pre>

<p>If you have more than one <code>org</code> project in your alist, this may not be ideal. You can set the value of the postamble for each invidual project, e.g.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-lisp" data-lang="lisp"><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">org-publish-project-alist</span>
<span class="o">&#39;&#39;</span><span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;project1&quot;</span>
   <span class="ss">:author</span> <span class="s">&quot;Your name&quot;</span>
   <span class="ss">:html-postamble</span> <span class="s">&quot;postamble for project 1&quot;</span>
  <span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;project2&quot;</span>
   <span class="ss">:author</span> <span class="s">&quot;Author of project 2&quot;</span>
   <span class="ss">:html-postamble</span> <span class="s">&quot;postamble for project 2&quot;</span>
  <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">))</span></code></pre></div>

<p>You can put HTML elements in the postamble.</p>
<h1 id="inclusion-of-table-of-contents">Inclusion of table of contents</h1>

<p>Two ways of doing this. First one is in the <em>org-publish-project-alist</em> declaration. Actually, you don’t have to do anything in there. TOC is included by default, if the <em>:with-toc</em> directive is not <em>nil</em> the exported HTML will always contain a table of contents unless otherwise overidden by <em>OPTIONS</em> variable in the org document itself.</p>

<pre><code>(setq org-publish-alist
'((
  "mynotes"
  :with-toc nil
  :base-directory "/somedir/"
))
)
</code></pre>

<p>The above example will supress the generation of TOC on every exported document. If you want to generated the TOC, remove the <em>:with-toc nil</em> statement</p>

<p>The second way of generating TOC is to put statement in the export options of each org document e.g. if you have a document named <em>somedocument.org</em>, it might look like this</p>

<pre><code>#+TITLE: My awesome document
#+TOC: headlines 1

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet /consectitur/ alet *si do*
</code></pre>

<p>Example document above will contain a table a TOC when exported. The value <em>1</em> means heading 1 will be exported. If you use the value <em>2</em> for headlines, TOC will contain until second level headings etc. The export options written on the org document itself will override whatever setting you have on the <em>project-alist</em> </p>

<h1 id="document-navigation">Document navigation</h1>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>The *UP</td>
      <td>HOME* navigation links can be exported on each document if you use the :html_link_up and :html_link_home settings on <em>project-alist</em> e.g.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<pre><code>(setq org-publish-alist
'((
  "mynotes"
  :with-toc nil
  :base-directory "/somedir/"
  :html_link_up "index.html"
  :html_link_home "../index.html"
))
)
</code></pre>

<p>If you put the link up/home directives in the alist, all exported HTML documents will contain a link to both home and up. This can be overriden on each org document using the OPTIONS template, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>#+TITLE: My awesome document
#+TOC: headlines 1

#+HTML_LINK_UP: index.html
#+HTML_LINK_HOME: somepage.html 

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet /consectitur/ alet *si do*
</code></pre>

<h1 id="embed-an-iframe">Embed an iframe</h1>

<p>Use <code>#+begin_html .. #+end_html</code> to embed the iframe. Make sure that in the document, you have turned off the subscript/superscript setting. In the org doc itself, just add the options line to turn off the subscript action, then you can use the begin..end blocks to insert HTML codes</p>

<pre><code>#+options: ^:nil

...

#+begin_html
&lt;iframe&gt; 

&lt;/iframe&gt;
#+end_html
</code></pre>
<ul>
  <li><strong>C u C u         :</strong> Collapse or expand all headings. It cycles visibility</li>
  <li><strong>C u C u C u     :</strong> Expand all headings</li>
  <li><strong>M x org-publish :</strong> Publish an org project (defined in alist)</li>
</ul>


  linux<p>You need to be sure you have a backup of your files. These commands are on CLI, if you make a mistake, the only way to go back is to restore the files using the tools found in the Dropbox website.</p>

<pre><code>
$ cd ~/Dropbox/thefolder
$ find . -type f -name "* conflicted copy*" -exec rm -f {} \;
$ awk '!/conflicted/' .git/packed-refs &gt; temp &amp;&amp; mv temp $ .git/packed-refs

</code></pre>

<p>The last command is applicable to you if the <strong>thefolder</strong> is also a git repo. If it is not, you should not use that command. Actually it won’t hurt if you accidentally typed that last command if thefolder is not a git repo because it will not find the <code>.git</code> hidden folder</p>
<p>Most of Vim addons can be installed manually, you just need to put them inside inside <code>~/.vim/</code> folder, but it’s a lot simpler to automate that install/config process if you use some sort of a Vim package manager. There are a couple out there, one of them is <strong>Vundle</strong>. First thing to do is to grab it from github. </p>

<p><code>$ git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim</code></p>

<p>Add the following lines to ~/.vimrc</p>

<pre><code>set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/vundle/Vundle.vim
call vundle#begin()

Plugin 'gmarik/Vundle.vim'
Plugin 'MarcWeber/vim-addon-mw-utils'

Plugin 'tpope/vim-markdown.git'
Plugin 'ricardovaleriano/vim-github-theme.git'

call vundle#end()
</code></pre>

<p>You don’t have to install all those plugins, go and read up what those plugins are supposed to do before you add them to your own vimrc. </p>

<p>If you used Vim to edit .vimrc, you can switch command mode and execute <code>:PluginInstall</code>. If you didn’t use vim to edit vimrc, you can start vim and install the plugins using the command <code>vim +PluginInstall +qall</code>. </p>

<p>If your platform is Debian, Ubuntu, Lubuntu or any of the Debian derivatives and you installed NodeJS via the <code>aptitude</code> or <code>apt-get</code> package manager, you may experience this error when you try to use NodeJS. Not only will this appear by using NodeJS itself but it may appear as well when you use any package gotten via <strong>npm</strong> e.g. <code>http-server</code> or <code>express</code>. </p>

<p>The error <code>/usr/bin/env node no such file or directory</code> means it is looking for the node executable in <code>/usr/bin/node</code> but it’s not there because what the package manager installed was <code>/usr/bin/nodejs</code> intead. </p>

<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>

<p>Either rename nodejs to node or just create a symlink. Better to just create the symlink</p>

<p><code>$ cd /usr/bin</code> 
<code>$ sudo ln -s nodejs node</code></p>

<p>Another way to solve this is get <strong>nodejs-legacy</strong> instead <strong>node</strong></p>

<p><code>$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs-legacy</code></p>

<h1 id="overview">1 Overview</h1>

<p>This guide uses gnokii-sms to send and receive SMS messages using Linux PC. The project I was working on did not require industrial grade throughput. That is the reason I cannot justify the cost of WaveComm iTegra type equipment. The SMS project was ran on a Debian Linux. If you are using a different distro, use the packaging mechanism of your distro.</p>

<p>There were a couple of other solution approaches but I went for gnokii-sms. I didn’t have a lot of time, which ruled out whipping serial I/O codes and concocting SMS messages using Hayes AT command set.</p>

<p>I could have used Kannel but it was so big. I only needed a simple mechanism to receve and send SMS message. I did not need a full gateway with all the bells and whistles.</p>

<p>GNOKii-SMS and Gammu were mature solutions. I went eventually with gnokii-sms but Gammu would have been a fit as well.</p>

<p>Hence, this mashup uses gnokii-sms. It is a stand-alone application with a daemon and it uses MySQL database as a datastore. I don’t need to learn any API in order to integrate it with my application. All I need to do is to write an application that will query the gnokii-sms backend. I won’t even alter the structure of the gnokii-sms database. My application will simply use gnokii for the SMS facility. No application logic will be added to gnokii-sms</p>

<p>This little project requires the following</p>

<ol>
  <li>A Linux PC. Debian was used but I got to test it on Crunchbang as well, worked out fine. It should work fairly well on the Debian derivatives e.g. Ubuntu, Xubuntu, Mint etc</li>
  <li>A USB modem. A post paid plan was used for the project, but a USB stick on pre-paid should work just as well</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="installation">2 Installation</h1>

<p><code>sudo apt-get update</code><br />
<code>sudo apt-get install mysql-server</code><br />
<code>sudo apt-get install gnokii-smsd-mysql</code></p>

<h1 id="config">3 Config</h1>

<p>Connect the USB modem to PC and find out which port it is using</p>

<p><code>sudo lsusb</code></p>

<p>Another command to use could be</p>

<p><code>sudo dmesg | grep USB</code></p>

<p>What you are looking for is the device name for the modem. Usually, the modem is at <code>/dev/tty0</code>, but just to be sure, run either lsusb or the dmesg command as stated above. Remember the device name because you will need it when you edit <code>~/.config/gnokii/config</code> — that is the configuration file for gnokii. </p>

<p>On some Debian derivatives like Crunchbang, the gnokii config file was not created during the installation . If that is the case, just create the config file manually.</p>

<p><code>sudo mkdir -p ~/.config/gnokii</code><br />
<code>sudo touch ~/.config/gnokii/config</code></p>

<p>Edit the <strong>config</strong> file. Set the port number and model to their appropriate values</p>

<pre><code>port=/dev/tty0
model=AT
</code></pre>

<p>There might a default value for the model property, it could be 6510. That value corresponds to a Nokia phone. But we are not using a Nokia phone, we are using a USB modem, so set the model value to <strong>AT</strong>.</p>

<p>Once done with the configuration, just do a quick test so that we know things are working out fine. Gnokii has a command that can quickly tell us if we are doing things correctly.</p>

<p><code>sudo gnokii --identify</code></p>

<p>It should give us some diagnostics and a quick peek if we did something wrong on the configuration file.</p>

<h1 id="database-backend">4 Database backend</h1>

<p>The gnokii-smsd-msyql package contains the SQL scripts necessary to create the table structure, but the database itself still needs to be manually prepared. </p>

<p><code>mysql -u root -p</code><br />
<code>mysql&gt; create database smsgw;</code><br />
<code>mysql&gt; use smsgw;</code><br />
<code>mysql&gt; \. /usr/share/doc/gnokii-smsd-mysql/sms.tables.mysql.sql;</code></p>

<h1 id="sending-and-receiving-sms">5 Sending and Receiving SMS</h1>

<p>First, the daemon smsgw daemon process needs to run. Get another terminal window and run the daemon process from there</p>

<p><code>sudo smsd -u root -p smsgw -c localhost -m mysql</code></p>

<p>To send an SMS message, the command is</p>

<p>The E130 is an entry level ThinkPad. It doesn’t have the same solid feel of the T420 or even the lower ends of the X series. It’s not a bad notebook though. For it’s price, it makes a pretty good type writer and secondary development machine.</p>

<h2 id="access-panel">Access Panel</h2>

<p>The ThinkPad Edge 130 has an access panel located at the bottom. It is secured by 3 Philip screws. Before you do any unscrewing and removal, make sure that
1.  It is not connected to the wall outlet. It’s powered down. The machine is off, not sleeping or stand by. Off
2.  The battery is removed</p>

<p>Carefully remove the screws and lift up the access panel. Once the panel is removed, you can pretty much get to the hard drive and the memory modules. </p>

<h2 id="replace-the-drive-with-ssd">Replace the drive with SSD</h2>

<p>This notebook’s drive is slim type. Which means if you will replace the drive, you need a drive with a 2.5” form factor. It should be SATA2 (or 3 if you cannot find SATA 2 anymore). This notebook uses the slim type SSD. You need to get one that is 7mm high. This kind of drive is usually used by ultrabooks, so it is no longer exotic. The local computer hardware shop probably carries it already. If not, you can always order it online. </p>

<p>In order to get to the hard drive chassis, you need to open the access panel at the bottom of the notebook. See the section above on how to do that. </p>

<p>See the official Lenovo support page on how to replace the hard drive . You will need a philips screw driver to remove the drive from the chassis. Just return it the same way you removed it. The replacement exercise does not involve much risk. There isn’t much that will get in your way.</p>

<h2 id="increase-the-ram">Increase the RAM</h2>

<p>The ThinkPad Edge 130 comes in a lot of varieties. Writing the exact specification of the RAM module in this page is futile. This page will become a wikipage for the E130, I can’t possibly keep up with that amount of information. The best way to upgrade the RAM is to inspect the existing RAM module. The speed specifications should actually be somewhere on the sticker of the RAM. Make a note of that and buy the additional RAM accordingly.</p>

<p>The second memory bay is usually empty. This notebook comes with 4GB out of the box. There are two clips on the side of the memory bay, you need to flex them a bit. You just need to be careful a bit, but there is no need to be nervous about it also. The official Lenovo support page for RAM replacement is here .  </p>

<h1 id="software">Software</h1>

<p>At the time of writing, Lubuntu’s version is 14.04. The Edge 130 should be able to handle the 64 bit version of Lubuntu. Why else would I put an 8GB RAM on this box if I wouldn’t use the 64 bit Linux. So head over to the  <a href="http://lubuntu.net">Lubuntu site</a> and get the 64 bit installer. Don’t worry even if the installer says <span class="underline">AMD 64</span>, that is the installer used, even on non-AMD processors. The Intel X86 is the 32 bit version, at the time of writing, there is no <span class="underline">Intel 64</span> installer of Lubuntu. You really will use the AMD 64 installer.  </p>

<p>Use your other PC to prepare the installer. If this is your first PC, then ask somebody’s help you prepare a Linux USB installer. When you buy most USB sticks, they are formatted in FAT32, don’t mess with that. There is usually no need to format those sticks.  </p>

<p>There are plenty of ways to prepare a Linux USB installer. The geeky way is to use <code>dd</code>, which assumes you already have a Linux machine. And since you are brave enough to try dd, you probably shouldn’t be reading this guide. Linux installation is elementary for you. Anyway, just in case you want to see how it’s done, there is a well maintained page over at Arch Linux detailing that installation technique. </p>

<p>Another way to prepare the USB installer is by using <a href="http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net">UnetBootin</a>. This software can run on Windows, Linux and OSX, so you shouldn’t have any problems getting it.</p>

<p>Stick in the USB, fire up UnetBootIn. Select the ISO image (the Lubuntu image you downloaded) and make sure you actually see that UnetBootIn has recognized the USB drive. Follow the prompts and you should have a Lubuntu installer</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Plug the USB installer on one the ports</li>
  <li>Power up the E130. Press RET (Enter key) quickly when you see the prompt</li>
  <li>The UnetBootIn menu should be visible. Choose “Install Lubuntu”</li>
  <li>There will be a series of guide questions, like choosing the language, keyboard etc. Do them accordingly</li>
  <li>Make sure you are connected to the internet. Although you can install Lubuntu while offline, it will save you hours of tweaking and troubleshooting if you do the installation online. If you will use WiFi to connect to the net, make sure you’re joined to WiFi access point before proceeding. Lubuntu will inform you of WiFi access points at this point of the installation</li>
  <li>Lubuntu will format the disk. You don’t have to do much. But you may need to select some action. Choose the one that says “Use the whole disk etc” or something like that. If there is an existing OS on the disk, the installer will ask you if you want to install Lubuntu side by side with this OS. You are on your own if you choose this route. This guide is about how to install Lubuntu and only Lubuntu on the E130 notebook. There are plenty of other resources on how to dual boot with Windows. This page is not one of them</li>
  <li>After a while, Lubuntu will setup a user. Type your full name, edit the name you want to give to the machine and your password</li>
  <li>Shortly thereafter, you will be asked to reboot. Wait for the screen that says “Remove the installation media and press ENTER”. Then, do as it says</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="configuration">Configuration</h1>

<p>Login to your shiny and blazing fast Lubuntu. When I timed it, it booted under 12 seconds. That’s how fast Lubuntu boots on an dual core i5 with 8GB RAM and SSD. Next, configure it.</p>

<h2 id="the-root-password">The root password</h2>

<p>Lubuntu doesn’t want you to use the root credential. I don’t want you too either. There is just too much danger. But there are times that you do need to use it. So, change the root password to something you can actually remember</p>

<p><code>sudo passwd root</code></p>

<p>It will ask you for a password. Type the same password you used to login. When you use <code>sudo</code>, you are being challenged for your <strong>own</strong> password, not root’s. The sudo command grants you elevated privileges only for the duration of the current command. It’s not forever. If you want to use an elevated privilege for a long time, use <code>su</code>. Now that will require the root password. That is why we are changing it right now to something we can recall from memory in the future.</p>

<h2 id="update-the-system">Update the system</h2>

<p><code>sudo apt-get update</code><br />
<code>sudo apt-get upgrade</code></p>

<p>After this, just install and get whatever software you need. You can refer to the <a href="/linux/linux-cheatsheet.html">Linux cheatsheet</a>
 for some ideas on what you can do and install in Lubuntu.</p>

<h1 id="copy-pasting-clipboard-tofrom-terminal">Copy pasting clipboard to/from terminal</h1>

<p>Can be done either via <em>xsel</em> or <em>xclip</em>. Xclip is part of most modern installations, so you it may be there in your installation already. The common usages are:</p>

<p>You copied something in an X window (browser or editor etc), you want to paste the content to the terminal. Unfortunately the terminal doesn’t have access to the clipboard. But you can do this on the terminal using </p>

<p><code>echo `xclip -selection clipboard -o`</code> </p>

<p>That command will echo the contents of clipboard to the console. If you wanted to append the clipboard contents to a file, you can do </p>

<p><code>echo `xclip -selection clipboard -o` &gt;&gt; somefile.txt</code> </p>

<p>and that will do the trick</p>

<p>If you  need to copy the <strong>contents of a text file to the clipboard</strong>. This can be done by </p>

<p><code>cat somefile.txt | xclip -selection clipboard</code></p>

<p>Now you can paste that content using <em>CTRL V</em> </p>

<p>Typing <code>xclip -selection clipboard</code> is just way too many keystrokes. Put an alias to it. In ~/.bashrc, add the following</p>

<pre><code>alias pbpaste="xclip -selection clipboard -o"
alias pbcopy="xclip -selection clipboard"
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can</p>

<p><code>echo `pbpaste` &gt;&gt; somefile.txt</code><br />
<code>cat somefile.txt | pbcopy</code></p>

<p>If you have an admin, ask for permission first if it is okay to do this. If it is just your own machine, go ahead and knock yourself off. You don’t need to do things as root — always. For that there is <em>sudo</em></p>

<h1 id="divide-your-terminal-screen-and-multiplex">Divide your terminal screen and multiplex</h1>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install tmux</code></p>

<p>You still need to configure tmux, but the basic idea is to launch tmux and do all your windowing there

<h1 id="rip-youtube-videos">Rip YouTube videos</h1>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install youtube-dl ffmpeg lame</code><br />
<code>cd ~/Videos</code><br />
<code>youtube-dl http:/youtubevideoaddress</code></p>

<p>The downloaded video is in <em>.webm</em> format, to convert to wav, do this</p>

<p><code>ffmpeg -i filename.webm filename.wav</code></p>

<p>To convert to mp3, do this further</p>

<p><code>lame filename.wav filename.mp3</code></p>

<h1 id="rdp-from-windows-to-linux">RDP from Windows to Linux</h1>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install xnest</code>  </p>

<p>Edit <em>etc/gdm/gdm.conf</em> then uncomment <em>RemoteGreeter</em> in the daemon section. Just delete the pound sign. Next, find the <em>xdmcp</em> section and change the value of the <em>Enable Key</em>, set it to <em>true</em>.</p>

<p>Log out so you can restart the GDM or you can execute this command</p>

<p><code>sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart</code></p>

<p>After that, the box is ready to accept remote desktop connections from Windows clients</p>

<p><strong>Get a download accelerator</strong></p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install axel</code><br />
<code>cd ~/Downloads</code><br />
<code>axel -n 10 http://wordpress.org/latest.zip</code></p>

<p>The int value of <em>-n</em> means the number of threads it will use to pull the file. Go easy on this one, don’t try to punish the web server by setting a very high number. 10 seems a bit excessive already.</p>

<h1 id="backup-a-mysql-database">Backup a MySQL database</h1>

<p><code>sudo mysqldump -u YourUserName -p --all-databases &gt; /path/to/dump/file.backup</code></p>

<p>The dumped file is basically text. They are SQL commands that has both structure and data of the dumped database. To restore the db from the dumped file, do this</p>

<p><code>mysql -u YourUserName -p</code></p>

<p><code>mysql&gt; create database nameOfNewDatabase</code><br />
<code>mysql&gt; use nameOfNewDatabase</code><br />
<code>mysql&gt; .\file.backup</code></p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install sysv-rc-conf</code><br />
<code>sysv-rc-conf</code></p>

<p>Use the minus sign(-) to stop processes and plus(+) sign to restart them. </p>

<h1 id="ssh-to-your-linux-box">SSH to your Linux box</h1>

<p>First, you need to make it an SSH server</p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install ssh</code></p>

<p>Then from a remote host, connect to it</p>

<p><code>ssh yourusername@remotehost</code></p>

<p><em>yourusername</em> has to be a defined account in the remotehost computer. You will be asked, the first time around, to store an entry inside ~/.ssh/known_hosts, say yes to this question</p>

<p><strong>Connect Windows to a CUPS printer</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Ping the CUPS printer, make sure there are no network connectivity issues</li>
  <li>Go to <em>Add Printers</em> dialog window</li>
  <li>Choose <em>Add network printer</em></li>
  <li>Choose <em>My printer is not listed</em>, because it might not be</li>
  <li>There will be a box provided, type <code>http://ipofCUPSprinter:631/nameofQueue</code>. The <em>nameofQueue</em> is something your sys admin would know, so ask him. Or you could simple open up a browser and go to <a href="http://ipofCUPSprinter:631">http://ipofCUPSprinter:631</a>, the name of the queue is usually listed in there under the <em>Printers</em> section</li>
  <li>Select a driver for the printer, most Windows 7/8 boxes can simply pull this from the internet</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="install-a-print-server">Install a print server</h1>

<h1 id="screen-capture">Screen capture</h1>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install imagemagick</code><br />
<code>cd ~/Pictures</code>
-   <strong><code>import -window root Image1.png</code>:</strong> Take the screenshot of the whole screen
-   <strong><code>import Image2.png</code>:</strong> The mouse pointer will turn to a crosshair, click and drag the screen region you want to capture
-   <strong><code>import -frame Image3.png</code>:</strong> Just like the command above but this one captures the frame of the window region</p>

<h2 id="other-options">Other options</h2>

<ol>
  <li><code>sudo apt-get install shutter</code></li>
  <li><code>sudo apt-get install gimp</code></li>
  <li><code>sudo apt-get install gnome-screenshot</code> if you don’t mind using gnome</li>
  <li>Just press PRT SC to get the whole screen</li>
  <li>Shift PRT SC to get just a portion of the screen</li>
  <li><code>scrot</code> This will silently take a screenshot of the whole screen, and will create a file on the current directory</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="mount-an-smb-or-cifs-share">Mount an SMB or CIFS share</h1>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install smbclient</code><br />
<code>sudo apt-get install cifs-utils</code><br />
<code>sudo mount -t cifs //servername/folder ~/mountFolder</code></p>

<p>If you don’t know the name of the folder that is shared, use the smbclient to discover it</p>

<p><code>sudo smbclient -L servername</code></p>

<p>If you don’t know the name of the server, although, you should, try to</p>

<p><code>arp -n</code></p>

<p>It should give you the list of servers that your machine already talked to. The problem is, what if you haven’t talked to that machine yet? You could try to</p>

<p><code>ping 255.255.255.255</code>  </p>

<p>Ping the whole network, try to see if you can recognize some servers in there</p>

<h1 id="system-time-is-wrong-all-the-time">System time is wrong all the time</h1>

<p>Edit <code>/etc/default/rcS</code></p>

<p>Reboot</p>

<h1 id="check-battery">Check battery</h1>

<p>The <code>ibam</code> doesn’t seem to be applicable anymore. But instead there are two commands that might do the trick</p>

<p><code>upower -e</code><br />
<code>upower -i &lt;power source&gt;</code></p>

<p>The -e option gives only the power sources, namely the battery and plugged power. The -i option gives a detailed info about the power source. So use the commands like this</p>

<p><code>upower -i `upower -e`</code></p>

<h1 id="terminal-color">Terminal color</h1>

<p>Find out first how many colors does the terminal already have. The <code>tput colors</code> command will tell you the current number of colors</p>

<p>On the <strong>~/.bashrc</strong> file, set the number of colors to 256</p>

<pre><code># ~/.bashrc

export TERM="xterm-256color"
</code></pre>

<p>If you do this, remove any setting from any tool e.g. tmux, emacs that will interfer with setting the TERM color.</p>

<h1 id="hp-laserjet-p1102w">HP LaserJet P1102W</h1>

<p>You will need quite a couple of things. This printer requires the hplip package. That is not all, it also requires a proprietary plugin from HP for it to function properly. </p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install hplip hplip-gui</code></p>

<p>Launch the HPLip Toolbox. If you are using Lubuntu with the default LXDE, it will be in the <strong>Preferences</strong> menu. If you are using <strong>gnome-do</strong>, it is so much easier to find, press the superkey + spacebar</p>

<p>After installation, if you have configured the P1102W properly, your workstation is on the same subnet as the printer, the HPLip Toolbox should have installed it already. In fact, if you check the line printer status, <code>lpstat</code>, you should be able to see the printer installed already.  </p>

<p>You need to set a default printer. This can be done using <code>lpoptions -d PrinterName</code>. If the LinuxMachine is equipped with GUI, it can also be done there. In Lubuntu it’s under <strong>System tools</strong> - <strong>Printers</strong>. If you don’t set a default printer, you might not be able to use commands such as <code>lpstat, lpr, lprm</code> etc.</p>

<h1 id="format-external-drive-to-fat32">Format external drive to FAT32</h1>

<p><code>sudo apt-install dosfstools</code></p>

<p>Find out the name of the actual device</p>

<p><code>sudo fdisk -l</code></p>

<p>If you simpy use fdisk without the sudo, you might not see all the disk</p>

<p><code>sudo mkdosfs -F -I /dev/sdb1</code></p>

<p>Substitute the actual device name to <strong>sdb1</strong>. The primary disk will be sda — sda1 is the first partition on the primary disk, sda2 is the second partition etc. If you have a second disk it will be <strong>sdb</strong>. If you have a USB external disk attached, it could be <strong>sdc</strong>. The disk has to be properly partitioned before you format it to FAT32. </p>

<p>You can use <strong>fdisk</strong> or <strong>cfdisk</strong> to created partitions. There are GUI tools to do this as well like <strong>gparted</strong>. Actually, it’s a lot easier to use gparted, so just go use that.</p>

<h1 id="hash-sum-mismatch-error">Hash Sum Mismatch Error</h1>

<p>During a software update, you might encounter this error. Just remove the contents of <strong>apt/lists</strong></p>

<p><code>sudo rm -fr /var/lib/apt/lists/*</code><br />
<code>sudo apt-get update</code><br />
<code>sudo apt-get upgrade</code></p>

<h1 id="nvpy">nvPY</h1>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install nvpy</code>  </p>

<p>Create a config file for nvpy </p>

<p><code>sudo touch ~/.nvpy.cfg</code></p>

<pre><code># .nvpy.cfg

[nvpy]
notes_as_txt = 1
txt_path = /home/thagos/Dropbox/notes

#disable simplenote syncing, use 1 to enable it
simplenote_sync = 0

# 0 value will sort in alphanumeric mode
sort_mode = 1
</code></pre>

<p>There is a detailed example and explanation of the cfg file in <a href="https://github.com/cpbotha/nvpy">https://github.com/cpbotha/nvpy</a></p>
<p>The fstab gets read during the boot sequence. If you have a second hard drive that you would like to mount during boot up, put an entry to it in the fstab. Add the following line to fstab to mount a second drive</p>

<pre><code>/dev/sdb1   /home/username/pathToMount  ext4  defaults 0 0
</code></pre>

<p>How do you know that it’s <strong>sdb1</strong> or <strong>sdb2</strong> or something else. Use any one of these commands to find out the block devices</p>

<p><code>lsblk</code>
<code>hwinfo</code>
<code>fdisk</code>
<code>hdparm</code></p>

<p>Here is a <a href="../resources/linux/fstab.sample.txt">sample fstab</a></p>

<h2 id="general-commands">General commands</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>lpstat -d:</strong> Find out if there is default printer configured</li>
  <li><strong>lpstat -p:</strong> See all the printers configured</li>
  <li><strong>lpstat -p -d:</strong> See all of the printers and the default printer</li>
  <li><strong>lpr &lt;filename&gt;:</strong> Send file to the default printer</li>
  <li><strong>cat &lt;filename&gt; | lpr:</strong> does the same thing as <code>lpr \&lt;filename\&gt;</code></li>
  <li><strong>lpadmin:</strong> CLI command to configure cups printers, but it is really much easier to use the web interface. Use the browser and go to <code>http://localhost:631</code>. You can pretty much do everything there and without memorizing all the command line flags needed by lpadmin. If you have no choice but to do the admin on the command line, the <strong>lpadmin</strong> command is well documented in <a href="http://www.cups.org/documentation.php/man-lpadmin.html">CUPS page for lpadmin</a></li>
  <li><strong>lpoptions -d printername:</strong> Set a default printer</li>
  <li><strong>lpq:</strong> See what print jobs are in progress and if there are ones on the queue</li>
  <li><strong>lprm &lt;job id&gt;:</strong> Cancel a print job. You need to know the job id, that is why you need to <code>lpq</code> first</li>
  <li><strong>lpoptions -p &lt;printerName&gt; -l:</strong> Show the settings of the printer</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="todo-printing-options">TODO Printing Options</h2>

<ul>
  <li>[ ] Why is OSX using the Manual feed always? Try out the 1102w on Linux</li>
</ul>

<p>Either the <code>lpr</code> and <code>lp</code> command will send contents of a file to the configured printer. But before you can print, you need a properly configured printer. Use either <code>lpadmin</code> for that, or configure the printer via the web gui admin at <em><a href="http://printserverNameOrIpAddress:631">http://printserverNameOrIpAddress:631</a></em> </p>

<p>The most basic usage is to send the contents of a file to the configured printer</p>

<p><code>lpr filename.ext</code></p>

<p>The terminal has no access to X clipboard. That is the general situation. Grabbing text from a GUI app e.g. text from a web page opened in a web browser cannot be simply pasted to xterm, or lxterminal or whatever terminal console you are using. Copying and pasting using CTRL c and CTRL v won’t work. At least not without the aid of some extra programs.</p>

<p>Xclip can help during these kind of situations. This program mostly comes automatic with the installation of a modern Linux desktop. My Lubuntu 12 came with xclip, installed already. But just in case you need to install it, you can grab it from the software repositories, a simple <code>sudo apt-get install xclip</code> should do the trick. Obviously this is the command to use for Debian or Debian derivatives such as Ubuntu, Lubuntu etc. For other systems. Use your package manager e.g. yum (for Fedora and CentOS)</p>

<p>Once xclip is installed, you can use to do two things. First is to echo the contents of the clipboard to a terminal console. </p>

<p><code>xclip -selection clipboard -o</code></p>

<p>If the clipboard has some contents, the command above will dump the textual content of clipboard on the terminal. Try to open some web pages, copy some text and then try out the above command on a terminal console.</p>

<p>A typical usage of this command is when you grab some text from document open in a word processor or a browser window, you can append it to a text file like this</p>

<p><code>xclip -selection clipboard -o &gt;&gt; somefile.txt</code></p>

<p>The second thing you can do with xclip is move the contents of a text file to the clipboard. This will then allow you to use CTRL v keyboard shortcut to paste the content (obviously to a word processor or program that uses X windows). </p>

<p><code>cat somefile.txt | xclip -selection clipboard</code></p>

<p>The command above should do it. If you have, say, GEdit or LibreOffice open, you can already use CTRL v to paste the clipboard content into your document.</p>

<h1 id="pbpaste-and-pbcopy-hack">pbpaste and pbcopy hack</h1>

<p>OSX has command line tools to copy and paste contents to/from the clipboard. These commands are <code>pbcopy</code> and <code>pbpaste</code>. You can define pbcopy and pbpaste aliases in the startup files so you can use these commands like you would in OSX. This hack benefits people who use both OSX and Linux. In ~/.bashrc, add the following</p>

<pre><code>alias pbcopy='xclip -selection clipboard'
alias pbpaste='xclip -selection clipboard -o'
</code></pre>

<p>Of course you need to quit your current terminal and restart it so the new settings will take effect. Or you can issue the command <code>source ~/.bashrc</code>.</p>


  c<h1 id="compiler">Compiler</h1>

<p>Make sure you have a modern C compiler. Linux, UNIX and OSX comes with compilers for C and  C++. Give it a quick test if you really have  a compiler. Get a terminal window and type</p>

<p><code>gcc</code></p>

<p>or </p>

<p><code>clang</code></p>

<p>Either of these two compilers will do.</p>

<h2 id="osx">OSX</h2>

<p>You need to download XCode before you can get the C compilers. So click the <strong>App Store</strong>, login and get XCode. When XCode is done downloading, open it and Go to Preferences. Download the command line tools</p>

<h2 id="linux">Linux</h2>

<p>If the C compiler is not yet installed, just get it via package manager</p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install gcc</code></p>

<p>Obviously this package manager is for Debian and the Ubuntus. Use the package manager of your distro if you are using anything other than Debian.</p>

<h1 id="hello-world">Hello World</h1>

<p>C is a compiled language. Which means you create your source programs by writing it in a source file, usually ending in <strong>.c</strong>, then you convert it to object code or compiled code. This is where you need the <strong>gcc</strong>. </p>

<p>Some textbooks may still refer to the compiler as <strong>cc</strong> (C Compiler). Just substitute it with <strong>gcc</strong>. GCC stands for Gnu C Compiler. </p>

<p>Many beginning programmers create the Hello World code as their first program. Don’t break tradition. That tradition started sometime in 1969 when Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan used it in their book, <em>The C Programming Language</em>. To manage the Hello World exercise, create source file named <em>hello.c</em> then put the following code in it</p>

<pre><code>//filename: hello.c

#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include&lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main() {
  printf("Hello World\n");
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
</code></pre>

<p>compile the above code using gcc. On  a terminal window, type</p>

<p><code>gcc hello.c</code></p>

<p>If you managed to type example code above without errors, you should compile without errors too. The compiler will produce the file <em>a.out</em>. Run the program with the command</p>

<p><code>./a.out</code></p>

<h2 id="compiler-options">Compiler options</h2>

<p>GCC has a lot of compiler options. One of them allows you to specify the output filename so that it reads something other than <em>a.out</em>. So compile your code again, this time using the command below</p>

<p><code>gcc hello.c -o hello</code><br />
<code>hello</code></p>

<p>The  <code>-o</code> flag of gcc means <em>output filename</em></p>

  android<h1 id="todo-rewrite-the-example">TODO Rewrite the example</h1>
<p>The Android SDK is a collection of tools and libraries to help you build Android projects. Before you can create projects, you must install the SDK. The SDK also installs, among other things, the Android Virtual Device or the AVD. The AVD emulates a physical android device. You can use this for testing your applications.</p>

<p>The SDK depends on other software. You need to make sure that you have the following installed on your system.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Java Development Kit. You will need the full JDK not just the JRE. The JRE is good only for running Java software, not for developing them. The prescribed versions of JDK is either 1.5 or 1.6 but I have experience running them on Java 7 and 8 without problems</li>
  <li>Apache Ant will also be needed. Android uses Ant as a build tool</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="download">Download</h1>

<p>The SDK can be downloaded from <a href="https://developer.android.com/sdk">https://developer.android.com/sdk</a>. Click the link which says “View all downloads and sizes”. The SDK is available for Mac, Linux and Windows, find the right installer for your platform and download it.</p>

<h1 id="configure">Configure</h1>

<p>At the time of writing, the SDK is packaged as a zipped file.  Unzip the downloaded file somewhere your disk. Unzip it preferably to a directory where you have read,write and execute privileges so you do not have to worry about tweaking permissions later. The name of directory where you unzipped the SDK files will be known as ANDROID_HOME. </p>

<pre><code>~/android-sdk-linux/

├── add-ons
├── build-tools
├── docs
├── platforms
├── platform-tools
├── samples
├── sources
├── system-images
├── temp
└── tools
</code></pre>

<p>The diagram above shows the folder structure of the unzipped SDK files on a Linux box. If you are on Windows, this could be <strong>c:\&gt;Users\yourname\android-sdk-windows</strong>. On a Mac it could read <strong>~/android-sdk-mac</strong>.</p>

<p>There are two specific folders in the ANDROID_HOME that you must include in your system path, the tools folder and the platform-tools folder.  The common utilities and commands that you will use in Android Development are found on those folders. </p>

<h2 id="mac">Mac</h2>

<p>You can edit your <strong>~/.bash_profile</strong> and include the following</p>

<pre><code>export ANDROID_HOME=/&lt;location of android home&gt;
export PATH=$PATH:ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:.
</code></pre>

<p>Replace <location of="" android="" home=""> with the actual directory location of your ANDROID_HOME</location></p>

<h2 id="linux">Linux</h2>

<p>You can edit <strong>~/.bashrc</strong> and include the following</p>

<pre><code>export ANDROID_HOME=/&lt;location of android home&gt;/
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:.
</code></pre>

<p>Replace <location of="" android="" home=""> with the actual directory location of your ANDROID_HOME</location></p>

<h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>

<p>You can include the path of tools and platform-tools using the GUI tools. Go to Control Panel, System Properties then go Environment Variables. You can put it either in User or System variables. If you do not have Administrative privileges on the Windows machine, you may not be able to alter the System variables. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you can create a batch file somewhere on your user directory and set the paths on that batch file.  Launch cmd.exe to get a command line window</p>

<pre><code>cd \Users\&lt;yourname&gt;
notepad adev.bat
</code></pre>

<p>Write the following inside adev.bat</p>

<pre><code>set ANDROID_HOME=c:\&lt;location of android home&gt;
set PATH=%PATH%/tools;%ANDROID_HOME%/platform-tools:.
</code></pre>

<p>You will need to run this batch file each time you open a cmd window so the Android path information can be recognized. The moment you close the cmd window, these path settings will be lost. If you include the Android paths using the System Properties method, will be permanent. Each time you open an cmd window, the paths will be set automatically.</p>

<h1 id="download-the-android-versions">Download the Android versions</h1>

<p>The SDK includes just the tools and utilities for development. It does not include the specific Android platform libraries that you will need. You will need to download the specific platforms/versions using the SDK manager. You may also need to download system images which will be required when you create an emulator. </p>

<p>Open a terminal window and type </p>

<pre><code>android
</code></pre>

<p>This will launch the Android SDK Manager. If you get a “bad command command or file name” or a “command not found error” that means you have not included the <strong>tools</strong> and <strong>platform-tools</strong> folder of the SDK into your PATH. Fix that first, then try the <strong>android</strong> command again.</p>

<p><img src="../images/android-sdk-manager.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>Android has been around for quite some time. There have been several versions of it over the course of many years. Each version of the Android platform can be downloaded using this tool. If you have a lot of bandwidth and disk space, you can download all of them by ticking all the check boxes you can find. Or you can simply download the Android versions you want to target for development.</p>

<p>If you want to develop apps that will run on KitKat, tick the box of “Android 4.4.2 (API 19)”. At a minimum, you will need the “SDK platform”, so check that. You will also need the “System Images”, check those that you want to use. If you are unsure which System Image you will need, just check “Intel X86 Atom System Image”.  </p>

<p>Scroll down the SDK Manager window and go to the “Extras” section. Check the “Android Support Library”. If you are on Windows, you might need the “Google USB Driver”, Mac and Linux users do not need the drivers. The USB drivers will be needed if you use a real Android device to run and test your app.  </p>

<p>Once you are happy with your selections, click the “Install packages” button. You will have to accept the license agreement before any download begins.  </p>

<h1 id="android-virtual-device">Android Virtual Device</h1>

<p>The Android Virtual Device emulate a real device. You can use this for testing your apps in place of a real device. I do highly recommend testing your app on real device before you release to the public. There is no substitute with real device testing.</p>

<h2 id="create-an-avd">Create an AVD</h2>

<p>You can create an AVD for any Android platform provided that you downloaded a System Image for it. To create an AVD, use the following command on a terminal window</p>

<pre><code>android create avd --name kitkat --target android-19 --abi default/x86
</code></pre>

<p>The preceding command will create an an AVD for android API level 19, which is KitKat version. It was given a name “kitkat” using the –name flag. The System Image used was the default/x86 image (Intel X86 Atom System Image). </p>

<p>If you are wondering how did we know what values to put in the command options, that answer is we got them by listing the available android targets. You can view the available targets using the command <strong>android list targets</strong>. It will list all the versions of Android which you downloaded earlier using the SDK Manager. Below is a snippet of the output using the android list targets command.</p>

<pre><code>id: 11 or "android-19"
     Name: Android 4.4.2
     Type: Platform
     API level: 19
     Revision: 4
     Skins: HVGA, QVGA, WQVGA400, WQVGA432, WSVGA, WVGA800 (default), WVGA854, WXGA720, WXGA800, WXGA800-7in
 Tag/ABIs : default/armeabi-v7a, default/x86 -   **&amp;#x2013;name**. Put any name you want, I used kikat in our example because it is descriptive -   **&amp;#x2013;target**. The API Level for your application. If we wanted to create a project that will run on JellyBean, I would have put android-18. But I did put android-19 because I wanted the app to run on KitKat -   **&amp;#x2013;abi**.  The name of the System Image that you will use for the emulator, in our example above I could also have used default/armeabi-v7a because it is also listed among the available targets
</code></pre>

<p>The create avd command has a couple of options you can use, but we only used three of them. You can pass other options that will affect things like skin, sdcard storage etc.  You can learn the other options of this command by typing <strong>android create avd</strong> without any options. That will display the help file.</p>

<p>Overtime, you will create more AVDs because you will target different Android versions. To find out how many and what kind of AVDs you already have created, use the command</p>

<pre><code>android list avd
</code></pre>

<p>That command will output the details of all the AVDs you have created.</p>

<p>You can test the AVD you just created by launching it</p>

<pre><code>emulator -avd kitkat
</code></pre>

<p>This command will launch the emulator in its own window. Just close the window if you want to terminate the emulator. </p>

<h2 id="alternative-avd-management">Alternative AVD Management</h2>

<p>The creation and management of AVDs can also be accomplished using the GUI tool of the Android SDK Manager. Launch the SDK Manager again using the <strong>android</strong> command from a terminal window. Go to “Tools” then “Manage AVDs”. </p>

<p><img src="../images/avd-creation.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>A project created with a default Activity will include an XML file and an Activity class. These two are given to you so you can get started quickly in displaying at least one screen in your application. The screen is of vanilla construction. This default layout is mostly used for some quick fire challenges. The kinds of things you do when you just want to test some things.</p>

<p>Real applications typically display some sophistication in their layouts. Let’s look at one small change you can do to effect some layout changes. The code snippet below is typical of the vanilla XML file given to us during project creation.</p>

<h2 id="review-of-linearlayout">Review of LinearLayout</h2>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span class="cp">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;LinearLayout</span> <span class="na">xmlns:android=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://schemas...&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  android:orientation=&quot;vertical&quot;
  android:layout_width=&quot;fill_parent&quot;
<span class="nt">&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The orientation is set to <strong>vertical</strong> and the layout_width is set to <strong>fill_parent</strong>. With those setting in effect, each View component you will add to this layout will be stacked on top of each other. The first View object to be added will be the one on top, the next View object will follow suit.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span class="nt">&lt;LinearLayout&gt;</span>
  android:orientation=&quot;vertical&quot;
  android:layout_width=&quot;fill_parent&quot;  

  <span class="nt">&lt;Button</span> <span class="err">...</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;CheckBox</span> <span class="err">...</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The preceding code example will result in a screen which has a CheckBox with a Button View right on top of it. The Button occupied whole width of the screen because the LinearLayout container says <strong>fill_parent</strong> on its layout width. The Checkbox did the same, it spanned the whole width of the screen for the same reason the Button did. No surprises here. This is how a linear layout is supposed to work. The behavior is expected. </p>

<p><img src="../images/linear-layout-vertical.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>There are some class of applications for which this kind of layouting might be okay. If the screen for example just wants to display a series of check boxes stacked on top of each other, like in a survey form, then this layout will suffice. No further tweaking is needed. </p>

<h2 id="weighted-layout">Weighted layout</h2>

<p>Let’s go to another layout example. Suppose we create a screen that allows a user to enter some data and when the user clicks a button, whatever he entered onto the text box will be added to a static text View, like a label. To build this example, we will need the following View objects: <strong>EditText, TextView</strong> and <strong>Button</strong>. </p>

<p>An EditText View allows for user input. If you have programming experience, you may have called this by a different name, perhaps you referred to it before as a textfield. Its the same thing. A TextView is a static text control. Some programmers call it a label. And you already know what a Button View does. </p>

<p>Once we have created a new project with a default Activity, we can add the Views to our Layout. It could look like the next code sample</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span class="nt">&lt;LinearLayout</span>
  <span class="na">android:orientation=</span><span class="s">&quot;vertical&quot;</span>
  <span class="na">android:layout_width=</span><span class="s">&quot;fill_parent&quot;</span>
  <span class="na">android:layout_height=</span><span class="s">&quot;fill_parent&quot;</span>
  <span class="na">xmlns:android=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

  <span class="nt">&lt;EditText</span>
    <span class="na">android:layout_width=</span><span class="s">&quot;match_parent&quot;</span>
    <span class="na">android:layout_height=</span><span class="s">&quot;wrap_content&quot;</span>
    <span class="na">android:id=</span><span class="s">&quot;@+id/editText&quot;</span>
    <span class="na">android:layout_gravity=</span><span class="s">&quot;center_horizontal&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>

  <span class="nt">&lt;TextView</span>
    <span class="na">android:layout_width=</span><span class="s">&quot;match_parent&quot;</span>
    <span class="na">android:layout_height=</span><span class="s">&quot;wrap_content&quot;</span>
    <span class="na">android:textAppearance=</span><span class="s">&quot;?android:attr/textAppearanceLarge&quot;</span>
    <span class="na">android:text=</span><span class="s">&quot;Large Text&quot;</span>
    <span class="na">android:id=</span><span class="s">&quot;@+id/textView&quot;</span>
    <span class="na">android:layout_gravity=</span><span class="s">&quot;center_horizontal&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>

  <span class="nt">&lt;Button</span>
    <span class="na">android:layout_width=</span><span class="s">&quot;match_parent&quot;</span>
    <span class="na">android:layout_height=</span><span class="s">&quot;wrap_content&quot;</span>
    <span class="na">android:text=</span><span class="s">&quot;New Button&quot;</span>
    <span class="na">android:id=</span><span class="s">&quot;@+id/button&quot;</span>
    <span class="na">android:layout_gravity=</span><span class="s">&quot;center_horizontal&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This will result to a screen where the EditText, TextView and the Button are stacked on top of one another. Each of the Views stretching out to the whole width of the screen. That may not be a problem for the width but it will be a problem for the height. Each View will vertically occupy just what it needs to display their content. The Button will size its height just enough to accomodate its label, the TextEdit will size itself accordingly to accomodate its current textual content and the EditText will size itself to accomodate a single line text input. </p>

<p><img src="../images/weighted-layout.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>The screen layout is not tight. There is plenty of unutilized screen space after the Button which makes the design clumsy. Putting screen space to good use gives the the app a more sophiscticated look. </p>

<p>A small change we can make is to anchor the EditText and the Button on the opposite sides of the screen, top and bottom to be precise, so that the TextEdit can stretch itself vertically in between and occupy whatever space is left. To achieve this result, we will assign layout weights on each View.</p>

<p>LinearLayout allows weight assignment for each View that is contained within. All Views by default are assigned a weight of zero. If the weight of a View is zero, the View cannot grow in space beyond what it needs to display its content. A View whose weight is more than zero is deemed to be more important. Hence it is allowed to stretch and hog the remaining space left on the screen.</p>

<p>To achieve our desired layout, we will make the weight of the Button and EditText zero and assign a weight of one to the TextView</p>

<p>The EditText and Button Views are now pushed to the top and bottom and the TextView stretched its height to fill up the gap left by other two Views. Because only the TextView is assigned a weight more than zero, it is the only View that can grow beyond what it needs for display. </p>

<p>Had we assigned all three Views equal weights of 1, all of them will grow in space beyond what they need but they will grow uniformly. The whole screen will be divided by three components. If we assigned each of them a weight of 2, you will not see any difference when they all had a weight of 1. Interesting things happen Views are assigned varying weights.</p>

<p>An Android project is required to build a single app. A project is a simple folder that contains a collection of XML, Java source, images, property and optional audio or video files. It has a very specific structure that stays the same for all android projects. With the exception of images, audio and video files which may be used by your project, everything inside this project are plain text files. This is the reason why some programmers can develop android applications using just plain editors.</p>

<p>The commands and utilities inside the Android SDK expects this structure and is optimized to work with it. If you deviate from this structure, you will have grief. It is not wise to build this project structure unaided by tools. At the very least, you should use the <strong>android create project</strong> utility included in the SDK. </p>

<p>Popular IDEs like Eclipse, NetBeans and Android Studio have wizard driven ways of creating an android project. But no matter what you use to create such a project, the structure of the files and folders is pretty uniform. </p>

<p><img src="../images/android-project-structure.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>The one on the left is a project created using just the SDK. The picture on the right was created using the Android App Studio, a full blown IDE for Android development. While the Android Studio project appears to have more files, the basic structure of the two projects remains very consistent. </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>src:</strong> a folder that contains the Java source files. All your program logic will be written on these files. If you want to do something when a user clicks a Button, starts you application or suspends an application, you will write them on the source files. And these source files will be stored here</li>
  <li><strong>res:</strong> a folder that contains other folders like “res”, “values” and some images. The folder names that says “drawable” contains images that your application may use</li>
  <li><strong>bin:</strong> When you compile the project, this is where the binary or executable files will be stored</li>
  <li><strong>libs:</strong> Sometimes you will need to use codes that other developers built. These third party libraries should be located on this folder</li>
  <li><strong>layout:</strong> Android favors the declarative way of defining user interfaces. The screens you will create can be built using XML files. This is the folder where XML screen files are stored</li>
  <li><strong>values:</strong> Hard coding string values is a dangerous practice. The idiomatic way of defining strings for labels, buttons etc is to store them in resource bundles. These resource bundles are nothing more than XML files. You will store the resource bundles in this folder</li>
  <li><strong>AndroidManifest.xml:</strong> Every project needs one manifest file. This file is important. It declares the things that are inside your application like how many screens it have, what their names are. It also affects the things your application can do. It declares whether your application can use the network, the local storage or the camera for example</li>
  <li><strong>local.properties:</strong> This file contains build configuration information e.g. the location of the Android SDK in your system</li>
</ul>
<p>An Activity is single screen that a user sees in your application. They are the primary ways for xyour application to communicate with the user. You will capture inputs with them and you will show outputs using them. If you  built Java applications for the desktop before, you might think of them as AWT Frames. </p>

<p>An activity is made up of two files. An XML file which defines what the screen looks like. How many buttons, menus and textfields it has etc. The second one is a Java source file which contains all the programming logic that will support the behavior of the screen. If you want something to happen when a user does something to the screen e.g. inputs a text or clicks a button, you will write that program logic on the Java source file.</p>

<p>We will create another Hello project in this chapter</p>

<p>Create another project with the following details.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Application Name</strong> is Hello</li>
  <li><strong>Minimum SDK</strong> is API 15</li>
  <li>Use a <strong>Blank Activity</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Activity Name</strong> is Main</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-xml-file">The XML file</h2>

<p>The XML file for an Activity will be stored in <strong>Hello/app/src/main/res/layout</strong> folder. There will be one XML file for each Activity. If you only have one Activity in your application, then there will only be one XML file in this folder. If you have several screens in the app, there will be several XML files here, one for each screen. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:paddingLeft="@dimen/activity_horizontal_margin"
    android:paddingRight="@dimen/activity_horizontal_margin"
    android:paddingTop="@dimen/activity_vertical_margin"
    android:paddingBottom="@dimen/activity_vertical_margin"
    tools:context=".Main"&gt;

    &lt;TextView
        android:text="@string/hello_world"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content" /&gt;

&lt;/RelativeLayout&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="java-source-file">Java source file</h2>

<p>This is just filler text. Delete this at once, once you find it</p>

<p>What is it
Why do I care
What is it made of</p>

<ul>
  <li>Java file. What, where is it. how di we get it.what’s in it, what are they for</li>
  <li>Layout file. What. Where is it. How did we gert it. What’s in it</li>
  <li>how are the two related. Via setcontentView nad R.layout.main – what’s that. Well the appt (Android Asset Packaging Tool) will compile all layout and values XML. It will produce the the R clas which you can use to get a programmatic reference to Views and resource bundles you have defined.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="multiple-activities">Multiple Activities</h2>

<h1 id="scratch">scratch</h1>

<p>An Activity is a screen. It is the visible part of the Android application. </p>

<p>What is it made of - a java file and an XML. It describes in XML what the screen should look like, will it have buttons, text fields etc. Will the Buttons stretch vertically or horizontally etc</p>

<p>What about it, what do they need to know</p>

<p>Create it. which is covered already but recapitulate it
Point out min sdk
package
name of Main Activity</p>

<p>Show the project structure again</p>

<p>What is Main.java
The visual content, is referencing R.layout.main 
What does setContentView does. Where did we get it
What does it mean that it extends androiv.view.Activity</p>

<p>Manifest</p>

<p>activity declaration
  intent filter, why is it important. It tells the Android runtime, that this is the activity that should be launched when the application is launched by the user. When you launch me, launch this activity first.</p>

<p>What about another activity.
  how to add another activity</p>

<p>What to put
 onCreate, why does it have super.onCreate(), then setContent again
 create another XML file, how in Android Studio. will the name of the XMLs case sensitive</p>

<p>How to put some things inside the screen file</p>

<p>Simple way to launch another Activity, use the XML for declaration</p>

<p>Why do we have add the second activity into the Manifest, because it will throw an ActivityNotFoundException - How did we know. Because I launched the DDMS. I need to tell them about the DDMS</p>

<p>What happens if you omit the setContentView of the second Activity, well, you will launch the second activity but you won’t see anything</p>

<p>This needs a video supplement</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>AndroidManifest controls everything
What it takes to add a new activity, create a Java file, create an XML, define in manifest and how to launch another activity is to use Intents, Excplicit intents</p>

<p>An Android project is made up of lots of files. Even the humble Hello World app, which is what we will do, requires more than just a single Java source file. An Android app needs a couple of XML files to facilitate user interfaces and overall configuration. Obviously it will need at least one Java program file and it could contain a couple of other resource files e.g. images etc.</p>

<p>While you can create and assemble an Android application without the aid of a tool, it can be difficult and cumbersome, not to mention, quite impractical. The Android SDK contains tools that helps to create, build and test projects. </p>

<p>At this point, you must already have a properly configured development environment. If you haven’t setup your environment, you can refer to <a href="android-environment-setup.md">Android Environment Setup</a> before going any further.</p>

<h1 id="creating-a-project">Creating a project</h1>

<p>We need to create a folder or directory where we can put all our project files. We will give that folder a name that is descriptive of the project. You can put this folder anywhere you like but there are some locations in your hard drive that might not be suited for a project like ours. Normally these places are folders where you don’t have read, write and execute privileges (rwx). You  have <strong>rwx</strong> capabilities on your home folder, so we wil put our project in there. The location of your home folder varies depending on what OS you use. </p>

<p>Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager. It’s a hypervisor (hardware assisted virtualization) that uses Intel VT. You use it to speed up the Android emulation on your machine. it allows for faster android emulation</p>

<p>There are two ways to get it, one is by downloading it from the intel site <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/android">https://software.intel.com/en-us/android</a> the other way is to download it using the Android SDK Manager. Under Extras, you will see the Intel x86 emulation installer (HAXM). Note that even if you download it using the SDK manager, it will not install the HAXM automatically. You still have to run the the HAXM installer. The installation instruction for HAXM is at <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/installation-instructions-for-intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager-mac-os-x">https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/installation-instructions-for-intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager-mac-os-x</a></p>

<h2 id="managing-the-haxm">Managing the HAXM</h2>

<p>To verify that its running</p>

<pre><code>kextstat | grep intel
</code></pre>

<p>You should see the kernel extension “com.intel.kext.intelhaxm”</p>

<p>To stop the haxm</p>

<pre><code>sudo kextunload -b com.intel.kext.intelhaxm
</code></pre>

<p>To start the haxm</p>

<pre><code>sudo kextload -b com.intel.kext.intelhaxm

<p>After running <code>ant debug install</code>, an error happens. </p>

<pre><code>BUILD FAILED

practice/helloworld/build.xml

Total time: 0 seconds
</code></pre>

<p>This is a build script problem. What the error tells us is that, it cannot find <strong>build.xml</strong>. How can that be? The android SDK tools actually setup up everything for us, the ant build script is one of the artefacts created when you start a new android project. There could be lots of reasons, but this particular error happened to me because I was using two machines for program development. And that I forgot to include the <strong>local.properties</strong> in the .gitignore file. So the settings and properties on one machine spilled over to the other development machine. </p>

<p>If you inspect the build.xml in your android project folder, you will find out that it is actually importing another <strong>build.xml</strong>, a generic one. This generic build.xml is located at <code>SDK.DIR/tools/build.xml</code>. SDK.DIR is the folder where you installed the Android SDK when you downloaded it. </p>

<p>The following example downloads and installs the android SDK</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>mkdir ~/progtools
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>progtools
<span class="nv">$ </span>wget http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk-linux.tgz
<span class="nv">$ </span>tar -xzvf android-sdk-linux.tgz</code></pre></div>

<p>This will create a folder named <code>~/progtools/android-sdk-linux/</code>. This is the SDK.DIR</p>

<p>To fix this error, you need to make sure that the value of <strong>SDK.DIR</strong> inside the local.properties file is pointing to the correct location. The local.properties file is located on the top level folder of your android project. </p>


<p>Things to look for;</p>

<p>context.getSystemService(Context.CONNECTIVITY_SERVICE) - What is this code doing</p>

<p>ConnectivityManager class, What are the static constants</p>

<p>LinearLayout.addView()</p>
<p>Android applications are comprised of Java executable codes, XML files and other application resources like video, images and audio. These are all bundled together inside an .apk file.</p>

<p>You will write your program in the Java programming language and compile them using the  Android SDK (software development kit). When the app is compiled, it becomes an android package. An android package is an archive file with a .apk extension. Think of them like zipped files for Android.</p>

<p>When applications have been built and digitally signed, they can be distributed on market places like Google Play or Amazon. They don’t have to be but these market places are frequented by a lot of people, your can benefit from exposure which the market places can offer. </p>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>

<p>Android may refer to many things, some people use it to refer to their mobile device and some others use the term to refer to the programming environment. That’s fine. For our purpose, what we mean by Android is a platform which have runtime components where mobile apps can run.</p>

<p>This platform is special version of Linux that is optimized for mobile devices. The Linux part takes care system services e.g. network and file operations, concurrency etc. The platform includes a bunch of other
things like WebKit which is the same browser engine that powers Chrome and Safari. It also has SQLite which you can use for database programming. It has other components useful for application development, but instead of listing all of them here, I will point them out in later when we need to use them.</p>

<p>The one other thing to point out in the Android software stack is the framework. The framework lets us do things such as create screens, write code that runs in background, listen to some events that may happen on the mobile device (and do something about it). The platform enables us to do all these things by simply extending existing classes in the
Android SDK.</p>

<p>Extending classes means utilizing the inheritance mechanism of Java to reuse existing functionality. The Android development team already wrote codes to display buttons and textfields for example. All we need to do, is to reuse them, mash them up or mix it up so we can use them in our own applications.</p>

<p>The Android SDK is a collection of tools and code libraries. SDK is short for software development kit. You will need to download, install and configure the SDK before you can start any development work.</p>

<h2 id="versions-and-api-level">Versions and API level</h2>

<p>Android has been around for quite some time. It has evolved so many times and as a result, there are various versions of it.</p>

<p>A version number will correspond to a code name. Buyers of Android devices would probably recognize the android versions using the codename rather than the actual number. As a developer, we need to be familiar not only with both the version number and codename, we also need to know the API level.</p>

<p>The API level is what you will see on the Android SDK manager. You will use the SDK manager when updating your software development kit.</p>

<p>By the time you read this, there could be changes or additions to the Android platform. The official site of Android keeps an updated list of this info over at <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html">https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html</a>. </p>

<h2 id="fundamentals">Fundamentals</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Creation of an app starts by creating an Android project. It is a simple folder that contains the Java sources, XML files, videos, audio, images etc. Depending on what IDE or tool you use, a project can be created and managed using either Ant, Maven or Gradle. These are called build tools and they are usually managed by the IDE. Most of the time, they are invisible to you</li>
  <li>Write the program logic using Java. Whether you would like to show something on the screen, listen to an event or do something in the background, Android has prebuilt classes to handle those. These prebuilt classes are part of the Android framework that lets us create rich apps by extending exisiting classes in the framework. We’ll discuss Application components a bit more later</li>
  <li>The screen user interface is, usually, constructed using XML. Widgets like buttons, textfields and other UI components are declared in the XML. Things such as size, alignments and weights of each component can be declared in this file as well</li>
  <li>Most of apps are event driven. They wait for the user to enter or press something then then some processing happens. Program logic is usually written as response to an event. These codes are the ones you write using the Java language</li>
  <li>The Java source file are converted to an executable form and the XMl is flattened as a result of the compilation process. The XML is converted to byte code representation, this is what we mean by flattened</li>
  <li>If the compilation is not successful, the compiler will you what’s wrong with it and you should fix it then compile again. If it compiles successfully, you will test the application by deploying it either an emulator or a real device connected to your computer</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="application-components">Application Components</h2>

<h3 id="activities">Activities</h3>

<p>If you want to create a screen that can interact with the user, you can do that by creating an Activity class. It is called that because the class you will create will extend the existing Activity class that is part of the Android framework.</p>

<p>By extending this class, you will be able to create other components such as buttons, textfields, lists etc and contain them inside a screen. You can also react to some events such as when an incoming call interrupts the user while using your application. </p>

<p>An Activity is basically a single screen that a user can see and interact with. Most applications will have more than one Activity. They have more than one screen. You can stitch Activities together using <strong>Intents</strong>. You can define a button on one Activity then write program logic such that when the button is clicked, it will launch another Activity. You will use Intents to launch other Activities.  </p>

<h3 id="services">Services</h3>

<p>Sometimes you will need to write code that is invisible to the user. One that doesn’t have a user interface. Surely you will need to launch it somehow from an Activity but once launched, the application just keeps on running. Even if the UI that launched it has already disappeared from view. A music player is such an example of this kind of app. A GPS enabled application which updates your location every now and then is another example.</p>

<p>If you need to build these kinds of apps, you will use <strong>Services</strong>. These are long running operations that are executed in the background. A Service is independent of the Activity that launched. Even if the UI screen that was used to launch the service has already died, the Service code just keeps on going.</p>

<h3 id="content-providers">Content Providers</h3>

<p>Each application runs on its own process. Its own virtual machine. This behavior of Android protects each application. If one badly written application goes wonky, it cannot bring the other running applications down. Its good for application stability. But this makes it nearly impossible for one application to access data from another. </p>

<p>Content Providers solves the problem of data sharing between applications. It is possible for you to write an application and share whatever data it has with other applications. The <strong>Contacts</strong> and <strong>Calendar</strong> apps in Android are good examples of apps that have Content Providers.</p>

<p>Don’t confuse Content Provider with your own database. If you create an application that uses a SQLite database, of course your application can access that. If, for example, you want to allow other applications to gain access to your app’s data, you can build a Content Provider. Your application will make the data available to other apps using standard URIs. </p>

<h3 id="broadcast-receivers">Broadcast Receivers</h3>

<p>Broadcast Receivers are used if you want to execute some program logic in your app as a response to events generated by either the Android system or other applications. You can, for example, inititate a database write when the phone receives an SMS message. You probably want to examine the SMS message and if it fits a certain criteria, you will record it to the database. This is one example of how to use Broadcast receivers.  </p>

<p>You can make your application listen to certain events. To do this, you need to register your application to listen to a specific event. Its the same concept when you subcribe to a mailing list. When there is a new mail, you get notified.</p>

<p>Apart from listening to broadcasted events, you can also make your application broadcast specific events. To do that, you will extend a specific Android class called the <strong>BroadcastReceiver</strong>.</p>

<p>BroadcastReceivers typically don’t have user interfaces. But you can create notifications that will show up on the status bar.</p>

<h3 id="android-manifest-file">Android Manifest file</h3>

<p>This is one of the most important parts of an Android app. The manifest is an XML file that needs be on the root folder of the application project. Every project needs one, and there can only be one per project. It needs to be named <strong>AndroidManifest.xml</strong>. The manifest declares lots of things like:</p>

<p>-the name of the application
-what kinds of components does the app have. Does it have Activities, what are their names. Does it listen to broadcast etc
-what kinds of things can it do with the mobile device? Can it access the network. The internet. Will it use the camera. Will it record a GPS location
-can other applications interact with this applcation. If so, what kinds of permission should these other applications have
-does this application use any external libraries (usually jar files that other people wrote)
-what versions of Android will this application run on. Will it run on Froyo (API level 8)</p>

<p>The Android manifest file is usually created by default when you start a new project. But it only provides some minimum declaration. Beyond the basic HelloWorld apps, you will need to learn how to work and manage the manifest file.</p>

<h3 id="other-resources">Other Resources</h3>

<p>Besides the programming components and the Android manifest file, your application may also include the following:</p>

<p>-*XML resource files* . XMLs are everywhere in Android. They are used to define screen layouts, manifest file, resource bundles etc.
-*Image Resources*. At a minimum, your app needs an icon that will appear on the Android apps menu
-*Video and Audio  Resources* .If you are building a game or a training application, your apps may contain lots of these
-*Third Party Libraries*. You include codes that other people built e.g. social media functionalities. These are included in the project in the form of jar files (Java archive)</p>

<h2 id="other-ways-to-build-android-apps">Other ways to build Android apps</h2>

<p>There are other ways to build an Android app. You can build apps using using languages other than Java. An app can be built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a middleware like the Cordova API, a good example of this is Phonegap. You can use C# to write apps and retarget the compilation to Android using a product called Xamarin. There are ways to build Android apps as well using Ruby or Python.  </p>

<p>There are tools or products that can build an Android app without coding or with minimal coding. MIT’s App Inventor is a example of this kind of tool. There are other tools like AppyPie, MakeMeDroid and Como. These app making tools are far too many to list down here. And by the time you are reading this, some of these names could be out of business already and new app makers have taken their places. Just search Google for “android app builder no code 2014” if you happen to still be reading this text in 2015, just substitute the current year in search term.</p>

<p>Our focus in here, of course, is to write our app using the Java language and build it using the Android SDK.</p>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.1" name="fn.1" class="footnum" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> Uniform Resource Identifier is just a piece of string that is used to identify a resource, such as a data resource that you would like to export using a Content Provider. It can appear like this: content://yourapp/resourcename. It looks a lot like what you would type in a browser address bar, although technically, what you use in a browser is called a URL (Uniform Resource Locator). Becauase a URL specifies not only the name of the resource, it also specifies the manner on how to get the resource (http). But for all intents and purposes, a URL is also a URI.</div>

<p>Setting up a development rig for Android varies a bit depending on what tool you will use. We will use the Android App Studio but we will brush a little bit on instlaling the barebones SDK as well. You do not have to follow the barebones SDK install </p>

<p>There are two different ways to install a dev environment, one is is via the pure SDK and using only the tools provided by the SDK  and some rudimentary programmign editor. The other way is using an IDE like Eclipse, Netbeans and Android App Studio</p>

<p>The IDE is a monilithic way and the SDK is more involved. </p>

<p>We will cover the Android App Studio. Why, because this is the tool endorsed by Google. While it is still in Beta, I don’t know, get some words from other authors</p>

</pre>

<h1 id="add-the-gitignore-and-readme-file">Add the .gitignore and README file</h1>

<p>cd to project folder, create a .gitignore file. You don’t want all of the files to be under source control e.g. location of the build.xml and the android-SDK, these information are specific to developer workstation and may not be true for all developers. Also, you don’t want generated files to be part of source control</p>

<p>A sample content of .gitignore</p>

<pre><code>bin/
gen/
ant.properties
local.properties
build.properties
project.properties
</code></pre>

<p>Don’t forget the README.txt. Even if you are working alone, it can’t hurt to write down your thoughts why you were trying to write that piece of code in the first place, put it in the README.txt</p>

<h1 id="work-often-commit-often-iterate">Work often, commit often. Iterate</h1>

<p>Keep adding files to the project, keep modifying files. At the end of the day, commit your changes. Now, the frequency of the commit is usually decided as a group. There are projects where you cannot until certain number of unit tests have been performed (and passed) etc. Know your project practices and adhere to them, but the last thing you want is losing a days worth of coding/unit testing, so commit to the repo religiously</p>

<h1 id="license-the-source-file">License the source file</h1>

<p>You need to decide which license you will use. Remember, if there is no explicit license on the source file, it means its a full copyright. No one can use your code, they will have to contact you and ask for express permissions — not that everybody abides by that, but still, if you intend other people to benefit from your creation, then license it either using a permissive license (like MIT or BSD) or the GPL or what have you.</p>

<h1 id="debug-observe-inspect-adjust">Debug, Observe, Inspect, Adjust</h1>

<p>Learn how to type ant debug install really quickly, better yet, use a text expander so you have a fighting chance against carpal tunnel syndrome</p>

<h1 id="beta-test">Beta test</h1>

<p>Send the app to friends, relatives, colleagues etc, look for feedback. Go back to the app, refine. Let your thoughts germinate some more. You need to iterate a bit on the app before you release to the wild</p>

<h1 id="sign-the-app">Sign the app</h1>

<p>ant debug install was fine for testing and development, but it cannot be consumed by other people without the developer signature. You need to <a href="/signing-an-android-app">digitally sign your app</a> before you release it to the public </p>

<h1 id="publish-to-google-play">Publish to Google Play</h1>

<p>You can make the app available from your website as a downloadable apk (android package) or you could pay Google Play so you can sell the app at the Google Market Place (its like iTunes or the Apple App Store for Android apps)</p>

  html5<p><strong>1. Resize the triangle</strong></p>

<p>Create a 500px wide HTML5 canvas that allows a user to increase/decrease the size of an equilateral triangle as shown in the picture. If the user clicks the small triangle pointing downward (labeled 1), the height of the triangle decreases by 5px. If the user clicks the small triangle pointing upwards (labeld 2), the height of the triangle increases by 5px.</p>

<p><a href="/images/triangle-exam.png">See the picture</a></p>

<p><strong>2. Move the circle</strong> along the path of the arc</p>

<p>Animate the small circle. Make it move from left to right. Start at the left-most part of the arc and finish at the right-most end. The movement of the circle will trace the curve of the arc. The arc is a half circle. The canvas is 500px wide.</p>

<p><a href="/images/arc-exam.png">See the picture</a> </p>

<p><strong>3. Bouncing ball</strong></p>

<p>Animate the ball inside the bounded region. The ball travels in a straight path. When it hits a side of the bounding region, it will bounce (like in a pool table). The angle of deflection does not need to physically accurate, you can use an arbitrary angle for the deflection (e.g. 45 deg). The canvas size is 500px wide by 500px tall</p>

  osx<p>Homebrew uses Ruby 1.8 and Yosemite uses Ruby 2.0. This is why Homebrew doesn’t work with OSX 10.10. This would have been easily fixed if you did a brew update and brew upgrade before going up to Yosemite. Just in case you did upgrade to Yosemite without upgrading Homebrew, the fix is this</p>

<p>Edit the file <code>/usr/local/Library/brew.rb</code></p>

<p>The first line on the file is</p>

<pre><code>#!/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/bin/ruby -W0
</code></pre>

<p>Replace the hard coded reference to the Ruby version number. The edited line should read</p>

<pre><code>#!/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/Current/usr/bin/ruby -W0
</code></pre>

<p>You have to commit the changes you made on brew.rb before you can brew upgrade, otherwise, you will be back to square one.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd $(brew --repository)
$ git commit -a -m "changed brew rb to point to Ruby 2
$ brew update
$ brew upgrade
</code></pre>

<p>If the cd $(brew –repository) command gives you problem, just cd to usr/local/Library then do the commit while in that directory.</p>

<p>Commit and push as usual</p>

<p>Mac OSX no longer includes Java. You need to install it on your own. The installation is straightforward, the Oracle site has an installer for OSX, just get that. The installer executes without issues and it automatically includes the Java executable to the system path.</p>

<p>The JAVA_HOME variable, however, is a different matter. The installer will not automatically create an entry for it. Some tools like ANT or Maven and some software like Tomcat does require that the JAVA_HOME be set, lest you will have some annoying command line issues with the tools.</p>

<p>There is a command line tool in OSX which points to the folder where Java is installed, the command is <code>/usr/libexec/java_home</code>. If you run it from a terminal app, it will point to the installation folder of the JDK. You can cut and paste the location of the folder in your <strong>~/.bash_profile</strong> so the JAVA_HOME variable will always be set when you use a terminal window. Or, instead of cutting and pasting the result of <code>/usr/libexec/java_home</code>, you can execute it as part of your startup script. Add the following line to  <code>~/.bash_profile</code>. </p>

<pre><code>export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
</code></pre>
<p>Mail.app in Yosemite has a default setting of using <strong>secure authentication</strong> when it sends password. If you email server is not using secure authentication for checking credentials, you will not be able to send out any email.</p>

<p>The fix is simple. You only need to uncheck two option boxes on the <strong>Accounts Preferences</strong> window of Mail.app. The two checkboxes will prevent Mail.app from overriding your manual setting. One of them is found on the “Advanced” tab of the Accounts Preferences and other other one can be found on the “Edit SMTP Server list” window. You will also need to check one option box that will allow you to send plain username and password to your server.</p>

<p>When Mail.app is open, go to <strong>Mail</strong> menu,  <strong>Preferences</strong>, then click the <strong>Accounts</strong> tab. </p>

<p><img src="../images/accounts-pref-1.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>Uncheck the box that says “Automatically detect and maintain settings”. If this is checked, Mail.app may overwrite whatever settings you change. We don’t need that. On the same window, find the option box that says “Allow insecure authentication”. This will let you authenticate using plain username and passwords.</p>

<p>From the “Advanced” tab, go to “Account information” tab and find the dropdown box for “Outgoing Mail Server”. </p>

<p><img src="../images/accounts-pref-2.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>Click the dropdown and go to “Edit SMTP Server list”</p>

<p><img src="../images/accounts-pref-3.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>Go to the “Advanced” tab and uncheck the “Automatically detect and maintain settings” option</p>

<p><img src="../images/accounts-pref-4.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>When Mail.app ask you if you want to save the changes, save the changes. </p>

<h1 id="editing-the-plist">Editing the plist</h1>

<p>The build of the Mail.app is suspicious, sometimes it respects the changes you’ve done on the Preferences window, sometimes it doesn’t. If you find that Mail.app is ignoring your changes, you can go straight to the <strong>plist</strong> file. </p>

<p>Open the file <strong>~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/Accounts.plist</strong>. Find the entry for <strong>UserAllowsInsecureAuthentication</strong> and make sure the value is <strong>true</strong></p>

<p>The snippet above is not the whole plist file, you need to look for a <strong>dict</strong> entry whose key is <strong>SMTPAccount</strong>. There is more than one dict entry in the plist file, so be careful where you make the changes. Make sure you are making on the email account which you’d like to allow for insecure passing of username and password.</p>

<h1 id="routing-table">Routing table</h1>

<p>The routing table does not show using <code>route print</code> in OSX, this may have worked in Linux but not here. Use the command <code>netstat -nr</code> instead</p>

<h1 id="showhide-hidden-files-finder">Show/Hide hidden files Finder</h1>

<p>The OSX Finder does not show hidden files by default. A file is hidden if the name starts with a dot or period e.g. <em>.bash_profile</em>, <em>.emacs.d</em> etc. If you want to see these kinds of files in the Finder, execute this commands using the Terminal.app</p>

<pre><code>$ defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAll Files -bool YES
$ killall Finder
</code></pre>

<p>To reverse the process, execute the following commands</p>

<p>The <code>killall</code> command will restart the Finder. After it has restarted, you should be able to see hidden files.</p>

<pre><code>$ defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAll Files -bool NO
$ killall Finder
</code></pre>

<h1 id="setting-the-hostname">Setting the hostname</h1>

<p>The <code>hostname</code> command, when executed on a terminal window will give you, well, the hostname, which is the name of your machine. On a networked environment, this hostname gets affected by DHCP; it overrides the hostname of your machine. If you want to set the hostname, execute <code>sudo scutil --set HostName anyname_you_want</code> on a terminal window</p>

<h1 id="anti-alias">Anti alias</h1>

<p>On the terminal, type</p>

<pre><code>$ defaults --currentHost write -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -int 1
</code></pre>

<p>The value 1 in <code>-int 1</code> means light anti aliasing, a value of <em>2</em> will set anti aliasing to medium and and <em>3</em> will be for strong anti aliasing</p>

<h1 id="homebrew-package-management">Homebrew package management</h1>

<p>You need XCode before you can install homebrew. Make sure you have downloaded it from the AppStore and that you have also installed it’s command line utilities. After that, get a terminal window and type</p>

<pre><code>$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
</code></pre>

<p>Ruby comes packaged with OSX so this command will work. Now test it out.</p>

<pre><code>$ brew install git # will install git
$ brew install wget
$ brew install curl 
$ brew install axel # wget in steroids
</code></pre>

<h1 id="colored-terminal-window">Colored terminal window</h1>

<p>They are in <em>~/Pictures/Photo Booth Library Pictures</em></p>

<h1 id="cli-copy-paste">CLI Copy Paste</h1>

<p>To copy content of files while on a terminal, use <code>pbcopy</code> e.g. <code>cat somefile | pbcopy</code>. The contents of somefile are now on the clipboard. You can paste it with the usual <code>CTRL v</code> if you are using any GUI editor. If you need to perform a paste on the terminal, use <code>pbpaste</code> e.g. <code>echo pbpaste</code>, the contents of the clipboard will be echoed to the terminal.</p>

<h1 id="assistive-technology-in-109-mavericks">Assistive Technology in 10.9 (mavericks)</h1>

<p>Not anymore in its usual place. This is now in <code>System Preferences -&gt; Security and Privacy -&gt; Privacy</code>. TextExpander will not work as soon as you upgrade to 10.9. But if you quickly visit and reenable TextExpander in Assistive technology dialog window, all will be well again</p>

<h1 id="scanning">Scanning</h1>

<p>Use <em>Image capture</em>, the <em>Scaner and Printer Queue</em> or <em>Preview</em>. All of these built-in software in have capabilities for image capture</p>

<h1 id="turn-off-iphoto-when-an-ios-device-connects">Turn off iPhoto when an iOS device connects</h1>

<p>When you plug an iOS device, iPhoto quickly springs into action offering to sync Photos. You can turn it off
1.  Launch <em>Image Capture</em>, <code>cmd + space</code> then type Image Capture in Spotlight
2.  On the lower left region of <em>Image Capture</em> window, look for <strong>Connecting this iPad opens iPhoto</strong>
3.  Click the dropdown. Choose <strong>No Application</strong></p>

<h1 id="external-usb-drives">External USB drives</h1>

<p><code>ffmpeg i movietitle.mkv -vcodec copy -acodec copy movietitle.mp4</code></p>

<p>This only involves changing of containers. No encoding or conversion will happen. If you have a lot of mkv files to convert, a script file is a better approach. On the same folder where the mkv files are located, create a script file, say <em>convert.sh</em>, type the following script inside the script</p>

<pre><code>for i in $(ls *mkv); do ffmpeg -i -vcodec copy -acodec copy $i.mp4; done
</code></pre>

<p><code>chmod u+x convert.sh</code><br />
<code>convert.sh</code></p>

<h1 id="share-internet">Share internet</h1>

<p>If you don’t mind OSX changing changing the subnet when <em>Internet Sharing</em> is activated, you don’t have to do this. If on the other hand, you have other devices that needs a fixed subnet e.g. file servers, other PCs that have statically defined IPs, then you need to control OSX’s behavior on NAT</p>

<p><code>sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.nat NAT -dict-add SharingNetworkNumberStart 192.168.3.0</code></p>

<h1 id="rip-audio-cds-to-mp3">Rip audio cds to mp3</h1>

<p>Get <a href="http://sbooth.org/Max/">MAX</a> from SBooth. Work on the archive files and put it in /Applications folder or where you want them. It’s a GUI tool, so it’s easy to work with.</p>

<p>MAX uses musicbrainz.org for the CD metadata, the service is not good enough. GraceNotes, which is used by iTunes is more capable. The problem is, I couldn’t find a direct way to connect MAX to GraceNotes. You need a bit of AppleScripting, this solution was the from the SBooth forums as well.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a Script in AppleScript, Save it anywhere you can find it easily. The script can be found on the link above (the sbooth forum), but I saved it in gist.github.com, here’s the link <a href="https://gist.github.com/tedhagos/5845190">https://gist.github.com/tedhagos/5845190</a></li>
  <li>When you insert the CD, iTunes will launch as well (you need this)</li>
  <li>Run the script you created. That will get the meta data of iTunes</li>
  <li>Rip Away</li>
</ol>

<p>This solution needs both iTunes and MAX running at the same time. When iTunes grabs the metadata from Gracenotes, the script grabs the metadata from iTunes</p>

</code></pre>

<p>dev/disk1 is where my CD is mounted, find out where yours is mounted. A simple <code>df</code> command should give you some clue where the CD drive is mounted. After that, ripping can start. To rip, do the following</p>

<p><code>diskutil unmount /dev/disk1</code><br />
<code>abcde</code><br />
<code>diskutil eject /dev/disk1</code></p>

<p>The unmounting is necessary because abcde works with raw block devices and cannot function when the CD is mounted. I shamlessly ripped most of this guide from <a href="http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=2005101620055677">extempore, MacWorld</a></p>

<code>sudo php -q go-pear.phar</code></p>

<p>PEAR installation will be at ~/pear/, bin, etc and all. Next, update your ~/.bash_profile to include pear in the system path.</p>

<p><code>cd /private/etc</code><br />
<code>sudo cp php.ini.default php.ini</code></p>

<p>Add the following to php.ini, it’s okay to add it at the very beginning, it didn’t give me problems that way</p>

<pre><code>detect_unicode = Off

<p>After saving the update php.ini,</p>

<p><code>cd /path/to/your/workarea</code><br />

<h1 id="keyboard-shortcut-for-full-screen">Keyboard shortcut for Full Screen</h1>

<p>There is no built-in or standard shortcut for entering fullscreen. You have to define it. It isn’t like Lubuntu where F10 gets any app into full screen mode. Fortunately, it’s quite easy to add a keyboard shortcut for it.
1.  Go to <strong>System Preferences</strong> → <strong>Keyboard</strong> → <strong>App Shortcuts</strong>
2.  Click <strong>+</strong> to add a new shortcut
3.  Type <code>Enter Full Screen</code> in the box labeled as “Menu title”. This essentially is a like programming a macro. You need to type <code>Enter Full Screen</code> (exactly as it is, including which letter is capitalized) because it is the title of the menu option in most applications responsible for entering full screen mode. If you mess up the spelling or the case of this entry, you won’t get the results you expect.</p>

<p>Though most applications have the <code>Enter Full Screen</code> menu title, some applications don’t follow this convention e.g. iTerm2. So you need to verify what is the exact text that an application uses to enter full screen and use what’s appropriate</p>

<p>The Mac Mini requires line level mic input. It needs to be powered. A mic that works on PC may not work on the mini.</p>

<p>If you just want to have a mic for the mini and it’s easier to buy than to improvise, go ahead and shop around for mics, there isn’t a shortage for third party products for the mini. On the other hand, if you have an old voice recorder equipped with a stereo mini jack (3.5mm) and don’t mind shopping around for a stereo mini jack connector (3.5mm also, obviously), then hack away.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find an old voice recorder. There could be one (or two) gathering dust in that sealed box of yesteryear-gadgets. I found an old Sony TCM-150. Any recorder with a built-in microphone should do it. I think even the more modern voice recorders with a 3.5mm socket should do the trick, but I don’t have a modern voice recorder.</li>
  <li>A 3.5mm stereo jack (mini jack) with both ends as male connectors. This can be easily procured at any audio supplies store or hardware supply store. I got mine from ACE hardware.</li>
  <li>Once you have procured the 2 items above. Connect the Mac Mini and the voice recorder using the stereo mini jack. You might want to check the batteries on that old voice recorder, I hope you did not forget to remove the batteries when you locked it away for keeping. If the dry cell batteries have leaked, the voice recorded may not be usable anymore.</li>
  <li>Power the voice recorder. Put in record mode (you can press the pause button so that it actually doesn’t record, we just need the mic)</li>
  <li>Test it. I tested mine by using it in a skype call. In fact, that was the only reason I needed a microphone for the Mac Mini</li>

  nodejs<p>Node has a <strong>REPL</strong> environment where you can interactively write commands and expressions. As you type something on the REPL, it will be evaluated and interpreted by Node and results will immediately shown to you. The REPL is a good tool to use for learning Node, but most of the things we will do in Node will not be on the REPL. We will write our programs in a JavaScript file and execute that file on the Node runtime. To Demonstrat this workflow, we will write a simple program.</p>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>

<p><strong>1. Create a Node source file</strong>. Node programs are JavaScript programs that run on the server side. But still, they are JavaScript programs nonetheless. Create a folder where you can store our exercise files. Ideally, this folder is inside your user folder. On a Mac this will be <code>/Users/yourname</code> and on Windows it will be <code>c:\Users\yourname</code></p>

</dl>
<p>Nodejs is available for a variety of platforms. You can get the binary distributions for installation on <a href="http://nodejs.org">nodejs.org</a>. There are binaries for Mac and Windows. If you are using Linux, you can get NodeJS from the Linux repositories appropriate for your specific flavor of Linux.</p>

<p>The installation using the binaries requires nothing more than downloading the installer file, double-cliking it and following the prompts. This is true for either the Windows or the Mac binaries.  </p>

<h2 id="program-editor">Program Editor</h2>

<p>NodeJS programs are JavaScript programs. Whatever you already are using to code in JavaScript, that is probably the best editor for you because you already know the quirks and tricks of that Editor.</p>

<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>

<p>Download the NodeJS installer file for your platform. Install it on your machine. Open a terminal window. A terminal window launches a shell program that allows you to issue OS commands. On a mac, you can open a terminal window by launching the <strong>Terminal.app</strong>, it is in <code>/Applications/Utilities/Terminal</code>. On Windows, you can use <strong>cmd.exe</strong>. Press the <strong>SuperKey</strong> on the keyboard and type <code>cmd.exe</code>. If you are using Windows 7 and below, press the <strong>SuperKey</strong>, go to <strong>Run</strong> and type <code>cmd.exe</code>. </p>

<p>After launching a terminal, type <code>node</code>. You should get to the <strong>node</strong> REPL</p>

<pre><code>
$ node
&gt;

</code></pre>

<p>Quit <strong>node</strong> by pressing <code>CTRL C</code>. It will ask you to press <code>CTRL C</code> again to completely quit. </p>

<p>The Debian and Ubuntu repos require that you pull npm separately from nodejs, maybe in the future this will change, but as far as <em>quantal</em> (Ubuntu codename), I still had to do this</p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install nodejs npm</code> </p>

<p>Another way to get npm is to do</p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install curl</code><br />
<code>curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh</code></p>

<h1 id="osx-install">OSX install</h1>

<p><code>brew update</code><br />
<code>brew instal node</code></p>

<p>npm should be part of the node formula. If the brew route fails, you can always download and install the binary package from <a href="http://nodejs.org">nodejs.org</a>. </p>

<h1 id="how-to-use-npm">How to use npm</h1>

<p><code>npm info &lt;name of package&gt;</code></p>

<p>The info argument spits out, well, info about a package — without installing it of course. It contains authors, versions, contributors, dependencies etc. It’s in JSON format</p>

<p><code>sudo npm install -g &lt;name of package&gt;</code></p>

<p>If you don’t put the <em>-g</em> (global) option, the package will be installed in the current directory. You may have to add that directory to the system path variable if you need to run the package from another directory. In global mode, the installed package will be runnable from any directory. Here are some examples of usage. </p>

<p>Next, install the extended runtime jars and the admin jars. It will ask for exactly the same questions.</p>

<pre><code>java -jar wlp-beta-extended.xx.xx.xx.jar
java -jar wlp-beta-admin.xx.xx..xx.jar
</code></pre>

<h2 id="installing-the-liberty-profile-in-eclipse">Installing the Liberty Profile in Eclipse</h2>

<p>If the <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/liberty-profile-beta/">WASDev.net</a> page is still open in your browser, look for the <strong>Online</strong> icon. Drag and drop the icon with the Eclipse logo inside an open instance of Eclipse. That will launch an installation window. </p>

<p><img src="../images/wasdev-page-net.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>You can also install the Liberty tools in Eclipse by using the Eclipse Market Place.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open Eclipse</li>
  <li>From the Help menu, click <strong>Market Place</strong></li>
  <li>Search for <strong>WebSphere</strong></li>
  <li>Look for Liberty Profile for Luna. If you are using Eclipse Luna, otherwise, find the Liberty Profile for whatever edition of Eclipse you are using</li>
</ol>

<p>Follow the prompts. Eclipse will restart after the installation</p>

<h3 id="creating-the-server-in-eclipse">Creating the server in Eclipse</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Click <strong>File</strong>, <strong>New</strong>, <strong>Other</strong></li>
  <li>Find the <strong>Server</strong> option</li>
  <li>When asked to select the Server type, look for the <strong>IBM</strong> folder and click <strong>WebSphere Application Server v8.5 Liberty</strong></li>
  <li>Accept the default server name</li>
</ol>

<p>It will ask you to either point to an existing Liberty Profile runtime or define a new location. We have already installed our runtime above, so we will use that folder</p>

<h1 id="creating-servers">Creating Servers</h1>

<p>The server scripts that you will need need are inside the *wasroot*/bin folder. For purposes of convenience, you may include that folder into your system path so you can invoke them from any directory</p>

<p>You can define many servers inside the Liberty Profile. Each server you create will be stored in the <strong>wasroot</strong> /usr/servers folder. Each server will have its own self contained configuration. </p>

<p>To create a server, run the command</p>

<pre><code>server create firstServer
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a server folder named firstServer. You should now see it in <strong>wasroot</strong> /usr/servers/firstServer</p>

<h2 id="starting-and-stopping-servers">Starting and Stopping servers</h2>

<p>To start a server, use the command <strong>server run firstServer</strong>. This will run the server in the foreground, which means you will see all the console logs on the terminal. You can also start the server using the command <strong>server start firstServer</strong> which will run the server in the background. You will not see the cconsole logs in the terminal, but they are logged inside <strong>wasroot</strong> /logs/console.log</p>

<p>A server that was started using the <strong>server run</strong> can be stopped by pressing <strong>CTRL C</strong>. If you started the server using <strong>server start</strong>, you need to stop it using the command <strong>server stop firstServer</strong></p>

<h2 id="server-configuration">Server Configuration</h2>

<p>The server configuration in WAS 8.5 is now a development artifact. This is a good thing because it is now simpler to include the server configuration in source control. When a server is created, you are given a really basic configuration file, but it has reasonable defaults. The Liberty Profile is configured by exception. It operates from a set of built-in configuration settings. </p>

<p>Each server you will create will reside inside the <strong>wasroot</strong> /usr/servers folder. In our earlier example, we created a server named <strong>firstserver</strong>. That server definition is inside <strong>wasroot</strong> /usr/servers/firstserver</p>

<pre><code>.
├── apps
├── dropins
├── logs
├── server.xml
└── workarea

4 directories, 1 file
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>server.xml</strong> file is located in the top level directory of a defined server, which in our case is named <strong>firstserver</strong>. If you try to run this server right now, without adding any JSP, Servlet or even a static HTMl file, you won’t see much. You will simply see the greeting page of the Liberty Profile. We will add some development assets to this project in a little while.</p>

<p>The listing below is an example of a server configuration for a newly created server</p>

<pre><code>&lt;server description="new server"&gt;

    &lt;!-- Enable features --&gt;
    &lt;featureManager&gt;
        &lt;feature&gt;jsp-2.2&lt;/feature&gt;
    &lt;/featureManager&gt;

    &lt;!-- To access this server from a remote client add a host attribute to the following element, e.g. host="*" --&gt;
    &lt;httpEndpoint httpPort="9080" httpsPort="9443" id="defaultHttpEndpoint"/&gt;

&lt;/server&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The Liberty Profile’s default port number is <strong>9080</strong>. It will listen on this port the moment you start a server. If you want your application to listen to another port number e.g. port 80, you simply need to change the value of <strong>httpPort</strong> in the server.xml file.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;server description="new server"&gt;

    &lt;!-- Enable features --&gt;
    &lt;featureManager&gt;
        &lt;feature&gt;jsp-2.2&lt;/feature&gt;
    &lt;/featureManager&gt;

    &lt;httpEndpoint httpPort="80" id="defaultHttpEndpoint" host="*"/&gt;

&lt;/server&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The listing above has two changes. The httpPort is now listening on port 80. Which means that when you access this on your browser, you won’t need to specify the port number anymore because 80 is the default for all browsers when it makes an HTTP request. The other change is that I have added a <strong>host</strong> attribute in the httpEndPoint element. This will allow you to access the application from any device other localhost. If you don’t specify the host attribute, you will not be able to access your application from remote machines.</p>

<p>The server.xml configuration file has the following characteristics</p>

<ol>
  <li>It is purely XML. Hence you can manage it using the simplest of editors. As such, it also human readable</li>
  <li>It is small, easy to back up and simple to include in a source control</li>
  <li>It can be shared across an application development team</li>
  <li>Composeable and feature driven. Features that you will add can easily add their own configuration to the system</li>
  <li>Forgiving. If you missed an attribute on the feature declaration, the built-in default values will kick in. The level of frustration is low</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>Features are the units of functionality by which you control the pieces of the runtime environment that are loaded into a particular server.</p>

<p>Use the configuration file server.xml to declare which features you want to load. The set of features is enclosed within the **<featuremanager>** element, and each feature within the **<feature>** subelement. For example:</feature></featuremanager></p>

<pre><code>&lt;server description="boo server"&gt;
  &lt;dataSource jndiName="jdbc/mysql"&gt;
    &lt;jdbcDriver id="mysqlDriver" libraryRef="mysql-connector"/&gt;
    &lt;properties URL="jdbc:mysql://localhost/liberty" password="" user="root"/&gt;
  &lt;/dataSource&gt;
 
  &lt;library description="MySQL JDBC Driver" id="mysql-connector" name="MySQL Connector"&gt;
    &lt;fileset dir="/Users/ted/progtools/mconnector" id="mysql-connector-jar" includes="mysql-connector-java-*.jar"/&gt;
  &lt;/library&gt;
 
  &lt;featureManager&gt;
    &lt;feature&gt;localConnector-1.0&lt;/feature&gt;
    &lt;feature&gt;servlet-3.0&lt;/feature&gt;
    &lt;feature&gt;jdbc-4.0&lt;/feature&gt;
  &lt;/featureManager&gt;
 
  &lt;applicationMonitor updateTrigger="mbean"/&gt;
 
  &lt;application id="AccessMySQL" location="AccessMySQL.war" name="AccessMySQL" type="war"/&gt;
  &lt;httpEndpoint httpPort="9080" httpsPort="9443" id="defaultHttpEndpoint"/&gt;

    &lt;webApplication id="DBAccess" location="DBAccess.war" name="DBAccess"/&gt;
&lt;/server&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The listing above is a server that uses quite a few features. It uses jdbc4 and servlet3 features. The localconnector was added to this server so we can use the Java Management Extensions, <strong>jmx</strong>, on this local server. It just speed things up a bit. For a more complete list of features, refer to <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/api/content/nl/en-us/was_beta_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/rwlp_feat.html">Liberty Features page</a></p>

Add a Servlet to project third, give it a name and specify any package to your liking. Implement the <strong>doGet()</strong> method and add a simple println command to it</p>

<pre><code>package com.tedhagos;

<p>In our JSP example earlier, we deployed the JSP project by using the <strong>Add and Remove</strong> context menu of the Liberty Profile server in Eclipse. For this example, we will explore the command line deployment.  </p>

<p>Export a war file for our project third. You can do this in Eclipse by clicking <strong>File</strong>, <strong>Export</strong>, then find the folder named Web, select <strong>WAR file</strong>.

<p>Next, copy the export war file to <strong>wasroot</strong> /usr/servers/firstserver/dropins. The <strong>dropins</strong> folder is constantly polled by the Liberty Profile. Any WAR or EAR file that you put here will be decompressed and deployed.  </p>

<h1 id="jvm-tuning">JVM Tuning</h1>

<p>Each server created in the Liberty Profile comes with the default JVM options. The defaults are reasonable but in case you need to tweak it, you simply need to create a file named jvm.options and place it at the root directory of a server folder. In our case, if we would like to alter some settings of JVM for our <strong>firstserver</strong>, we need to create the options file and place in <strong>wasroot</strong> /usr/servers/firstserver/jvm.options. If you want the JVM options to be applicable to all servers, put the options file in <strong>wasroot</strong> /etc/jvm.options.</p>

<p>A change in the JVM options is one of the rare occassions where you have to restart your servers.  </p>

<p>One of the most settings tweak that is done to the JVM is to alter the memory allocated to JVM. By default, Liberty Profile has the following setting</p>

<pre><code>-Xms4m
-Xmx488m
</code></pre>

<p>That means the minimum Java heap size is 4 megabytes and the maximum heap size is 488 megabytes</p>

<p>On the rare occassion that you want to see a verbose log of the garbage collection process, you can include the following setting on the jvm.options. </p>

<pre><code>verbose:gc
</code></pre>

<p>There are many settings that can be set in the jvm.options file, for a complete reference, you can consult this page <a href="http://jvm-options.tech.xebia.fr">JVM Options page at Xebia.fr</a></p>

  jekyll<p>The <strong>categories</strong> variable is a list in Liquid. In order to selectively display posts that belongs to a specific category, we need to do 3 things. First is to traverse all the <strong>posts</strong>, then traverse the <strong>categories</strong> list  and lastly, inquire if the category is a match to the category we want to display on the page. The code snippet below will display all the post, the title at least, that belongs to the ‘linux’ category.</p>

<pre><code>
{% for post in site.posts %}
  {% for cat in post.categories %}
    {% if cat == 'linux' %}
      {{ post.title }} &lt;br/&gt;
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, we can use the <strong>site.categories.CATEGORY</strong> variable in Jekyll to do exactly what the code sample above does. I prefer the second approach because it has less code. It is easier to read, maintain and most importantly, less processing time.</p>

<pre><code>

{% for post in site.categories.linux %}
  {{ post.title }} &lt;br/&gt;
{% endfor %}

  php<p>There are four ways to include other php scripts into the current file. PHP has four statements that allows us to essentially copy the contents of another php script and embed it on the script currently being evaluated. These statements are</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>include(“scriptname.php”)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>include_once(“scriptname.php”)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>require(“scriptname.php”)</strong></li>

<p>http://php.net/manual/en/function.include.php</p>
<p>MAMP is short for Mac, Apache, MySQL and PHP. It is the WAMP (Windows Apache MySQL PHP) equivalent on Macs. The installer bundles 3 programs, a web server (Apache), a database server (MySQL) and a scripting language (PHP).</p>

<p>You don’t need the MAMP installer in order to get the 3 programs, Apache in fact, is bundled with OSX. You can get the other two programs using eithe Fink, Brew or Macports. So why are we bothering with MAMP? Because MAMP gives an installation process that has less hassle or friction. Installing the 3 programs without MAMP involves more than just downloading and running installer programs. There is configuration that needs to be done afterwards. It is the configuration activity that usually gets beginning programmers stomped. Wiring the 3 programs to work together can prove to be daunting if it is your first time to setuy a web stack development environment. MAMP eases that configuration process for us.  </p>

<p><strong>1 Download the installer</strong></p>

<p>The installer is at <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/">mamp.info/downloads</a>. The MAMP installer has 2 editions. The first one is simply called MAMP and the other is MAMP Pro. There is only one installer for both editions, so just hit the download button. After the installation, you will be asked if you want to upgrade to MAMP Pro. The differences between the two editions is beyond our scope for now. </p>

<p>Install the downloaded file just how you would install any other Mac programs. You will be guided by a series of wizard-type dialog boxes.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Continue</strong> on this screen</p>

<p><img src="images/mamp-1.png" alt="mamp-1" /></p>

<p>Also click <strong>Continue</strong> on this one</p>

<p><img src="images/mamp-2.png" alt="mamp-2" /></p>

<p><strong>2 Read the license agreement</strong> and click <strong>Continue</strong></p>

<p><img src="images/mamp-3.png" alt="mamp-3" /></p>

<p>Agree to license agreement and click <strong>Continue</strong></p>

<p><img src="images/mamp-4.png" alt="mamp-4" /></p>

<p><strong>3 Accept the default setting</strong> which is “install for all users” and click <strong>Continue</strong></p>

<p><img src="images/mamp-5.png" alt="mamp-5" /></p>

<p>The screen tells you how much space it will take up on the disk. It also offers a slight customization. If you want to install the program files to a folder other than the default, you may do so by clicking the <strong>Change Install Location</strong> button. You will be asked where you would like to put the program files instead. For now, just accept the default location and click <strong>Continue</strong></p>

<p><img src="images/mamp-6.png" alt="mamp-6" /></p>

<p>The installer, by default will put the program files in <strong>/Applications/MAMP</strong> folder. This is a system folder, and as such is  off-limits to users who don’t have administrator or root privileges. That is why the installer is asking for permission if you would like to allow the action. </p>

<p>In order to proceed, you need to give your password to the installer. This is the same password that you use when logging in to your Mac. It is also the same password that you installed other applications on your Mac the past. After typing your password, click <strong>Install</strong></p>

<p><img src="images/mamp-7.png" alt="mamp-7" /></p>

<p><img src="images/mamp-8.png" alt="mamp-8" /></p>

<p><strong>4 Close</strong> the installer when all files have been written to disk. You will notice that the “Continue button” has been replaced by <strong>Close</strong> </p>

<p><img src="images/mamp-9.png" alt="mamp-9" /></p>

<p><strong>5 Launch MAMP</strong>. Open a Finder window and click “Applications” on the side bar. If you prefer to use the Finder menu, click <strong>Go</strong> then <strong>Applications</strong>. Alternatively, you can also press <strong>Shift + CMD + A</strong>, that will also take you the Applications folder. The MAMP program is inside the MAMP folder. Double click it.</p>

<p><img src="images/mamp-10.png" alt="mamp-10" /></p>

<p>Ignore this warning. We are not going to use MAMP Pro. Also you may want to uncheck the box that says “Check for MAMP Pro when starting MAMP”, so that the next time you launch MAMP, you won’t be bothered by warning again.</p>

<p><img src="images/mamp-11.png" alt="mamp-11" /></p>

<p>Click <strong>Launch MAMP</strong></p>

<p><img src="images/mamp-12.png" alt="mamp-12" /></p>

<p>The management screen of MAMP is a bit simplistic. Notice that Apache and MySQL has status indicators on the right upper portion of the screen, but there’s none for PHP. You won’t see PHP in there because PHP is already configured to work with Apache. Also, PHP is not a standalone program, its a scripting language, so a status indicator doesn’t really make sense for it. </p>

<p><strong>6 Configure</strong> the services</p>

<p>At the moment Apache and MySQL are not running. When they do, the status boxes will change their colors to green. Right now they are greyed out because. Do not click the <strong>Start Servers</strong> just yet. We still have to do a little bit of configuration. To do that, click <strong>Preferences</strong></p>

<p><img src="images/mamp-13.png" alt="mamp-13" /></p>

<p>There is not much to configure on the “Start/Stop” tab, except to check the box that says “When starting MAMP, Start servers”. This way, everytime we start MAMP, Apache and MySQL will start automatically. </p>

<p>Next, we will configure the Webserver. Click the <strong>WebServer</strong> tab</p>

<p><img src="images/mamp-14.png" alt="mamp-14" /></p>

<p>MAMP contains two webservers, one Apache and the other one is NGINX (pronounced as engine X). NGINX is relatively newer, and arguably, faster than Apache. Both are very capable webservers but they are architecturally different. The choice on what to use between the two is not always obvious because it depends on what language and other technologies you will use in your web application. A discussion on the merits or comparisson of these two webservers is beyond our scope. </p>

<p>For our purpose, we will use Apache. Apache is already selected by default, so you don’t need to anything there. </p>

<p>The next item we will configure is the <strong>Document Root</strong> or docroot for short. The docroot is a special folder that holds all the files of your website or web application. When somebody goes to your website by typing its URL address on a web browser, the webserver, which in our case Apache, it will look for files to serve inside the docroot folder. The MAMP installer decided that it will put the docroot on /Applications/MAMP/htdocs, but we can change that. </p>

<p>Changing the location of the docroot has some benefits for developoment. If we relocate it to somewhere inside our user folder, then we can add, edit, modify and delete files inside the docroot to our heart’s content without being bothered to authenticate ourselves each time. </p>

<p>To change the location of docroot, click eithe the arrow icon or the folder with ellipsis (the one with 3 dots) right beside the <strong>Document Root</strong> label. It will launch a Finder window and let you select a new folder which will be the new docroot.</p>

<p><img src="images/mamp-15.png" alt="mamp-15" /></p>

<p>Select a folder somewhere inside /Users/yourname, in my case, I am  choosing a folder inside my ~/Dropbox folder named <strong>cares</strong>. Click the <strong>Select</strong> button</p>

<p><img src="images/mamp-17.png" alt="mamp-17" /></p>

<p>The location of the new docroot is now selected and reflected on MAMP preferences. Click <strong>Ok</strong> to close the preferences window.</p>

<p><img src="images/mamp-18.png" alt="mamp-18" /></p>

<p><strong>7 Start MAMP</strong> by click the “Start Servers” icon. Wait for a little while until you see the status boxes of Apache and MySQL turn green. As soon as the server starts, a browser session will automatically be launched for you and you will see the welcome page of MAMP.</p>

<p><img src="images/mamp-19.png" alt="mamp-19" /></p>

  phonegap<p>To install the PhoneGap SDK, you will need <strong>NodeJS</strong> and <strong>npm</strong>. You can download the binaries of Node which are available from the <a href="http://nodejs.org">nodejs.org</a>. The binaries are simple to install, just install them as you would do any other software you installed on your platform. It is as simple as download the file, double click it, follow the prompts. You may to adjust your system path settings after the installation so that you can run node and npm from the command line.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can install node and npm using some package managers. On a Mac with Homebrew as package manager, node and npm can be installed as follows.</p>

<p>On a terminal window, run the following command</p>

<pre><code>$ brew update
$ brew doctor
$ brew install node # this will install npm as well
</code></pre>

<p>On Windows with Chocolatey as package manager, run PowerShell as Administrator and then run the following command</p>

<pre><code>C:\&gt; cinst node -y
C:\&gt; cinst npm -y
</code></pre>

<p>Next step is to install the PhoneGap tool chain</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo npm install -g phonegap
</code></pre>

<p>On Windows, run <strong>cmd</strong> as Adminstrator then run the command</p>

<pre><code>C:\&gt; npm install -g phonegap
</code></pre>

<p>If you get a “command not found error”, the node and npm directories are probably not yet added to system path variable. Make the necessary adjustment/edits to the path variable and run the npm install command again.</p>

<p>When the installation has finished, run <code>phonegap</code> on a command line just to make sure everything installed properly. The result you should get from running <code>phonegap</code> should be a help screen, not a “command not found error”</p>
