		    <p>The whole getting started, syntax, Dropbox integrations, getting paid etc are all on <a href="http://leanpub.com/manual">http://leanpub.com/manual</a>
. The book is free. There is no execuse why you should not read it.</p>

<h1 id="orgmode-doc-to-leanpub-markdown">Orgmode doc to Leanpub Markdown</h1>

<p>This is settled already. There is no export to do. Org mode is pre writing. I will write in Markdown when publishing to LeanPub. Practice your typing!
-   What kind of markup do I use
-   Are all of them handled gracefully by the Orgmode exporter
-   If not, what are the solutions. Perhaps sed and awk</p>

<ul>
  <li>What happens to footnotes</li>
  <li>What happens to beginex â€“ they are actually respected by LeanPub</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="heading-structure">Heading Structure</h2>

<p>Keep the #title for the title, but make sure that the chapter title is is heading 1, which meang single asterisk. When you export the document to markdown format, the chapter title becomes heading 1</p>

<p>Use the traditional orgmode. Write as it is.</p>

<h1 id="how-will-you-handle-beginexample-and-endexample">How will you handle begin_example and end_example</h1>

<p>Sed scripts, perhaps</p>
