	<p> 
	<p>You will underestimate the efforts on your first API project. Even if you have done many an estimations before and you have participated in many a projects, if none of them were API development, you will be painfully reminded that <em>there is always a first time for everything</em>.</p>

<p>API projects are not exactly the same as a web app, or mobile app or a desktop app. They should not be estimated as such. You will spend more effort on development and unit testing on API projects.</p>

<p>Once you have built the API, you will spend time testing it. The way to test it is to build an application that will use the API. &mdash; shouldn't you actually build a unit test also for that app that will use your API? If you won't, how will you get an insight on how the APIs will be used by others. You need to get into the heads of your users if the API is to be robust.</p>

	<h2><a href="/fixed-deadlines-moving-scope">Of fixed deadlines and moving scopes</a></h2>
	<p> 
	<p>A common tale on software projects &mdash; there is hard stop somewhere down the line, a fixed date when to ship the software out of the door, but the scope is still moving.</p>

<p>In a perfect world, before a single line of code is ever written, everybody involved in software development (including the client) has a good understanding of what needs to be done, how to get there, how much sweat will it take and for how long everybody sweats &mdash; in a perfect world.</p>

<p>It isn't perfect. It isn't smooth. It isn't always peaceful. It isn't always cool. There are lots of people involved, lots of people have stakes, not everybody is aware of what's going on, and not everybody is on time. While Agile methods have taught a lot of people not to do things serially and and not to put things in the critical path, the software development phase is not the be-all and end-all of projects. There are other people involved in the value chain of projects, and some (a lot, actually) are way up on this chain &mdash; these are people waiting to pay for the software (more often than not, they have already paid for the software), people who promised some other people a delivery date for the software, people who manage some people who promise some other people a delivery date for the software, so on and so forth. Like it or not, they can exert a lot of influence on when that software should be out of your door.</p>

<p>If you have been doing this long enough, you have an overdeveloped thick skin for the vicissitudes of the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle). If you are new at this, prepare for temper swings (yours and other people), but keep your cool. Flaring up, yelling matches and snide emails are not useful &mdash; contemplation is.</p>

<p>There are 3 things you need to be acutely aware of in a project. First, how much work is there (features), how many people do you have to work on them (resource) and how much time do you have (deadline) &mdash; that's the basics. If one of these three things move, you need to start taking notes of how it will impact the other two &mdash; and there is always impact.</p>

<p>If the scope of the project keeps moving, either the deadline or the resources will stretch. Stretching the resources can mean either extending their hours (beyond 8) or adding warm bodies to the project. Neither has desirable effects. When you stretch people's working hours, their focus is thinly spread, the brain needs a healthy dose of sleep. People who are tired makes more mistakes. You might be able to ship that software after all, but it might not behave like you expect it to. Adding warm bodies is  a pipe dream also, at least on short projects &mdash; the ones you measure in months, not in multi-years. You are throwing new comers to the deep-end, they will need to familiarise and absorb what your other guys have been working on in the past couple of months. They will ask questions and clarify things &mdash; you will spend time with them; and its time you don't have. Familiarise your self with the law of diminishing returns.</p>

<p>So, the only thing left to manage is the deadline &mdash; and this is a very sensitive area to a lot of people, this is the one that causes tempers to flare. When tempers flare, just check your own, there is nothing you can do with other people's temper and demeanour. A discussion on moving the deadline will always be a difficult one; accept it, prepare for it, discuss it calmly and intelligently. Don't get sucked into the blame-storming frenzy that ensues. Focus on problem solving.</p>

<p>The tricky part about running out of time is that it's not always easy to tell when you are. Projects are never late one week or one month. Projects are late one day at a time, it won't seem so bad on the first day you find out you are behind. It might not seem so bad even during the second day &mdash; and there is the rub. How do you tell when it's bad enough? How can you be certain that 4 more hours of delay will negatively impact your team's ability to deliver the software, as agreed and as expected? Where is the point when recovery and salvage are no longer possibilities? Sadly, it's an acquired skill, every project is different &mdash; some or all of the people in your team might be different, a different client, slightly different set of features, different version of libraries you are using  etc. &mdash; You just need to do it long enough and plenty enough to get better at it.</p>

	<h2><a href="/480-minutes-of-focus">480 minutes of focus</a></h2>
	<p> 
	<p>That's 8 hours. It's a stretch to increase it, no matter how badly you want to.</p>

<p>Every morning you've got 24 potential-filled hours, sounds like a lot, but after;</p>

<ul>
<li>waiting on elevators (.25 hours, cumulatively)</li>
<li>getting to work (1 hour)</li>
<li>(actually) working (8 hours)</li>
<li>light social activity, water cooler talk (.25 hours)</li>
<li>lunch (1 hour)</li>
<li>getting home (1 hour)</li>
<li>dinner (1 hour)</li>
<li>hygiene and other physical necessities (1.5 hours)</li>
<li>get appraised on current events (1 hour)</li>
<li>sleep (8 hours)</li>
</ul>


<p>the day is finished.</p>

<p>A non-trivial subject could require 120 minutes of blocked time, these are the kinds of task that (hopefully) will have big pay offs. Hopefully again, you could get at least 2 of these big chunks each day &mdash; but that is constantly threatened by telephone rings, people walking into your workspace, noisy cubicle neighbors and many others. So, do you really need to get interrupted by Twitter, Facebook and that annoying sound your email app makes when something arrives.</p>

<p>My primitive brain is taking over, it's telling me to do nothing, conserve energy (that means sleep) and eat (fast and plenty)&mdash;I know that if I take my eyes off the focus for the day, the lazy guy is gonna win. I have to shake this monkey off my back, I've got lots of things to do today&mdash;maybe a 15 minute cardio should perk me up again; or coffee, that can do the trick too; just don't put sugar in it because the lazy guy loves sugar.</p>

	<h2><a href="/two-hours">The first two hours</a></h2>
	<p> 
	<p>Wake up 2 hours earlier than your usual. After the morning rituals, coffee etc, don't turn on the computer, don't check your email, don't check messages on your phone lest your mind will wander around, will fleet from thought to thought and
get filled with <em>little things</em> &mdash; remember what Stephen Covey said on <em>First things First</em>, rocks first, then stones, then pebbles then sand. Look at the rocks first, attend to the rocks first. Stay disconnected for the first two hours. Use the time to;</p>

<ol>
<li>Look at your todo list for the week</li>
<li>Look at your todo list yesterday, if some items fell in the crack, add them to the list for the day. Can't steal time</li>
<li>Write (rewrite) the todo list for the day. See which ones in the list can be done in 2 hours, but can potentially contribute the most to results of the day (80/20). Be brutal about the selection. Those task that will not make the cut are probably less important anyway&mdash;either delay them, queue them, delete them altogether.</li>
</ol>


<p>The first two hours is important, it sets the tone of the day. If you don't set the tone, the hours will pass by and you will wander aimlessly; sure you will respond to emails, answer your phone, engage in conversations&mdash;but those are probably the 80% of your activity that gives rise to only 20% of your results (maybe even a lot less than 20%)&mdash;do the important stuff first; the important ones for you, that is.</p>

	<h2><a href="/the-task-list">the task list</a></h2>
	<p> 
	<p>As you move through your task list for the day, it doesn’t hurt to include what artefact will it produce. What do you expect to get out of it. Sometimes a task doesn’t have an artefact, and that’s fine—but more often than not, a task does have an artefact, even if it is just a single page containing your notes, and how you clarified your thoughts on it.</p>

<p>It is important to ask what is the victory condition for the task, when do you stop working on it. If the victory condition is unclear, then maybe the task is bigger than what you originally thought it was—tactical or long term goal, perhaps.</p>

	<h2><a href="/holiday-blues-low-grade-stress">holiday blues, low grade stress</a></h2>
	<p> 
	<p>The sinking feeling you are getting is most likely because you have a lot of thoughts in your mind. Specifically thoughts that make you feel guilty that you haven’t done enough and you wasted way too much time watching movies, checking on your website and scanning through emails&mdash;holiday breaks can do that to you.</p>

<p>After a movie marathon, couple of packs of cigarettes, lots of caffeine and serial eating, it’s a bit difficult to go back to a centered state of thought. You will fall out of rhythm. This happens from time to time, your mind is playing tricks because your short term memories are not about work, they are about decadence&mdash;and its a tricky business to catch yourself when you are accelerating towards decadence and lethargy. It usually takes a boss or another authority figure to kick you from behind or give you a whack on the back of your head so you can get buttoned up again.</p>

<p>That sinking feeling is a stressor, it’s low intensity but it lingers. It’s a lot like the flickering light on your work area or the slow march of traffic you go through everyday. Adrenaline is not going to solve it. You cannot simply explode into action, beat it to a pulp or run away from it.</p>

<p>Luckily, you already wrote down your list of long fuses — you have written them down, haven’t you? — and you keep a journal pretty regularly&mdash;you do keep a journal, don’t you?&mdash;A list of long fuses keeps your eyes on the far horizon and your journal records some minutiae of the tactical challenges you were trying to solve before you drifted into the path of aimless-ness. Get back on those, let your mind get on the groove of your task list. You can’t swallow an elephant, you got to slice it up in bite-sized pieces.</p>

	<p> 
	<p>What exactly is that one thing you are waiting to happen before you do the big things on your list. You’ve already done the Guy Kawasaki advise, M-A-T right? So what’s eating you up. Why are you dragging your feet.</p>

<p>What conditions are you waiting for. A perfect sunny day wasn’t part of your assumptions, you were gonna do these things regardless — it’s just lethargy isn’t it? or you don’t think you deserve it. You think it’s not  ”you”,  not within your elements — or its’ too deep for you.</p>

<p>You need to practice more writing. Articulate exactly what are the things that need to happen first, before the big things on your list start happening.</p>

<p>Big things on your list mostly falls under the category of multi-step problem. You can’t skip the intervening solutions and jump right to the last problem — maybe that is what’s keeping you, because you think you can</p>

	<h2><a href="/move-forward-or-sideways">move forward or sideways</a></h2>
	<p> 
	<p>For most problems, looking for that one right answer is a natural approach to take. Process of elimination is very ingrained and wired deep into our thinking — it’s not a bad way to solve problems. But when you are stomped, the logical approach maybe of limited use. Another way to proceed could be to think sideways, the process of generation. The goal is not to eliminate options, rather to generate them.</p>

<p>The rub is to know when to move forward and when to move sideways. This is probably why the thinking process is an art form.</p>

	<h2><a href="/thought-snowball">thought snowball</a></h2>
	<p> 
	<p>Try to avoid mental snowballing. This one usually occurs when you are so absorbed into a negative detail. You will begin rehearsing one thought after another in your mind, you might even rehearse conversations that will eventually make you feel agitated.</p>

<p>Thought rehearsal is good, if it’s a positive thought, if it’s a negative thought, it should be dealt with differently. Out of the 10 (bad) things you think will happen, 1 (or maybe none at all) will happen.  Life is short, time is short&mdash;such a waste to spend it in paranoia</p>

	<p> 
	<p>Don’t try to take on the challenges at once. Speed of response is not always a priority. Sticky problems always have lots of things underneath them — the ones that you don’t see;  Remember Pareto? 8 parts of the problem is submerged and unseen. You need to uncover them first before you can solve the 2 parts of it which are visible and are in your face.</p>

<p>This is why you need to always catch your self when you are in an agitated state. Going from thought to speech in 10 seconds is a dangerous thing. Absorb, relax, collect your thoughts, ask the 5 whys, then formulate a response</p>
