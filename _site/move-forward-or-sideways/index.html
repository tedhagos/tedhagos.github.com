      <p>For most problems, looking for that one right answer is a natural approach to take. Process of elimination is very ingrained and wired deep into our thinking — it’s not a bad way to solve problems. But when you are stomped, the logical approach maybe of limited use. Another way to proceed could be to think sideways, the process of generation. The goal is not to eliminate options, rather to generate them.</p>

<p>The rub is to know when to move forward and when to move sideways. This is probably why the thinking process is an art form.</p>
