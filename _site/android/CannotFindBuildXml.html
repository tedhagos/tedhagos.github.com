		    <p>After running <code>ant debug install</code>, an error happens. </p>

<pre><code>BUILD FAILED
/Users/ted/workarea/android-training/practice
/helloworld/    build.xml:83: Cannot find /Users/ted/
progtools/android-sdk-macos/tools/ant/build.xml 
imported from /Users/ted/workarea/android-training/
practice/helloworld/build.xml

Total time: 0 seconds
</code></pre>

<p>This is a build script problem. What the error tells us is that, it cannot find <strong>build.xml</strong>. How can that be? The android SDK tools actually setup up everything for us, the ant build script is one of the artefacts created when you start a new android project. There could be lots of reasons, but this particular error happened to me because I was using two machines for program development. And that I forgot to include the <strong>local.properties</strong> in the .gitignore file. So the settings and properties on one machine spilled over to the other development machine. </p>

<p>If you inspect the build.xml in your android project folder, you will find out that it is actually importing another <strong>build.xml</strong>, a generic one. This generic build.xml is located at <code>SDK.DIR/tools/build.xml</code>. SDK.DIR is the folder where you installed the Android SDK when you downloaded it. </p>

<p>The following example downloads and installs the android SDK</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>mkdir ~/progtools
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>progtools
<span class="nv">$ </span>wget http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk-linux.tgz
<span class="nv">$ </span>tar -xzvf android-sdk-linux.tgz</code></pre></div>

<p>This will create a folder named <code>~/progtools/android-sdk-linux/</code>. This is the SDK.DIR</p>

<p>To fix this error, you need to make sure that the value of <strong>SDK.DIR</strong> inside the local.properties file is pointing to the correct location. The local.properties file is located on the top level folder of your android project. </p>
