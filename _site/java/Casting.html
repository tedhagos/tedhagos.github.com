		    <p>You already know what <strong>upcasting</strong> is, we discussed that not too long ago. Upcasting happens when you assign a narrow type to a wider type e.g. an <strong>int</strong> value assigned to a <strong>long</strong>. Java does for you automatically, no intervention needed. The opposite of <strong>upcasting</strong> is of course, well, <strong>downcasting</strong> — not very creative, I know, but it makes the two terms easier to remember. </p>

<p>Downcasting happens when you force a wider type into a narrow type e.g. try to assign an <strong>int</strong> to a <strong>byte</strong>, the compiler won’t let you. Unlike upcasting, downcasting is an explicit activity. It needs action from the programmer. </p>

<p>Let’s go back to the byte arithmetic example of Fig 4. We solved that by making variable <strong>c</strong> a int. We also could have solved that problem using downcasting.</p>

<pre><code>class ByteAdd {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    byte a = 1;
    byte b = 2;
    byte c = (byte)(a + b);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The cast operator is the pair of parentheses. We are forcing the value to the right of the cast operator, in this case <code>(a + b)</code> which is a <strong>int</strong> to become a <strong>byte</strong>. You have to group expression <strong>a + b</strong> because if you did not, only the value <strong>a</strong> would have been casted to a byte, then the addition operation would be performed (which results to an int) then it will be assigned to <strong>c</strong> — the cast operator has a higher precedence than the addition operation, that is why you need to group.</p>
