		    <p>By far and thus far, the data types you have seen are called <strong>primitive types</strong>. The Java Type System has another kind of type. It is called <strong>reference types</strong>. Let’s defer the discussion for reference types at least until after we’ve gone through the OOP topic. </p>

<p>For now, what we need to remember is that, if it’s not primitive (double, float, long, int, short, byte, char or boolean) then it must be a reference type. It’ not all scary, some reference types are actually pretty to use, for example, the <strong>String</strong> type which you have been using all  along since the Hello World program.</p>

<pre><code>String a = "Hello";
String b = "World";
String c = a + b;
int d = 10;
String e = a + d; // attention here
</code></pre>

<p>I called your attention to the last line because I thought this might be a good opportunity to explain why the addition operator works for a String type, what happened to our rule before — when a <strong>double</strong> is added to something else it becomes a double.</p>

<p>First, let’s put an addendum to our rule. <strong>When something is added to a String</strong> the whole expression becomes a String. The String type rules them all.</p>
