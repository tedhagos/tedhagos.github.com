      <description>Preface material
Who is this for? It&amp;rsquo;s for a beginning programmer, but I&amp;rsquo;m assuming this isn&amp;rsquo;t your first programming language — HTML doesn&amp;rsquo;t count, but if you coded a bit of JavaScript, then that counts.
The very fundamentals of coding won&amp;rsquo;t be tackled in here. I&amp;rsquo;m already assuming that your quite familiar with some of the tenets of imperative programming, like, statements are arranged in sequence, they execute one after another unless redirected by a branching construct like an if, or a looping construct like a do; or variables can hold data, they have a memory address and we can replace that data whenever we like — stuff like that.</description>
