      <description>The Kotlin collections are actually direct instances of the collections in the JDK. There’s no conversion of wrapping involved. So, if you didn’t skimp on your study of collections while you were in Java, that will certainly come in handy now. Although Kotlin didn’t define its own collections code, it did add quite a few convenience functions to the framework, which is a welcome addition because it makes the collections easier to work with.</description>

      <title>Higher Order Functions</title>

      <description>The name higher order functions come from the world of Mathematics, in there, a higher order function is also called functional, functional form or functor, and apparently, they take the difference between function and values, a bit more seriously than programming folks.
 NOTE It makes me wonder if there a thing such as &amp;ldquo;lower order functions&amp;rdquo;, I don&amp;rsquo;t think this term was ever used, neither in programming nor in the world of Math.</description>
