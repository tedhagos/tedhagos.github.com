You can install vagrant using precompiled binaries. Head over to [vagrantup.com](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) website and download the installer appropriate for your platform. These are wizard type installers, so you will install them in a familiar way. Download, then double click, then follow the prompts.

Alternatively, you can use the package manager of your platform. OSX has either MacPorts or Homebrew. Windows has got chocolatey and Debian derived Linuxes has got the aptitude package manager.

On OSX homebrew, you could install vagrant this way

~~~
brew update
brew tap caskroom/cask
brew install brew-cask
brew cask install vagrant virtualbox
~~~

On a Windows machine with chocolatey, you can do it this way

~~~
cinst --y virtualbox vagrant
~~~

On Debian derived Linux box, you might do the following

~~~
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install vagrant virtualbox-dkms
~~~

Make sure everything has been installed properly. On terminal window, run the following commands

~~~
vagrant --v
vboxmanage - v
~~~

If you saw the actual version numbers of vagrant and virtualbox instead of getting a "command not found" or "bad command or filename" error, that means virtualbox and vagrant are good to go.
