<h1>the site</h1>

<p>
  It's a blog site. It has my notes on a couple of subjects. Most of the notes are technical in nature, I use them for teaching. It also contains notes that are non-technical, they mostly tilt towards soft-skills.</p>
<p>There is no explicit navigation on the front page because I haven't gotten to working on it yet; it is possible that I will never get to work on a clear, crisp and SEO friendly organization for this site, so here is how it is structured.</p>

<h3><a href="http://tedhagos.com">0. tedhagos.com</a></h3>
<p>
  primary site, this part contains the non-technical notes.</p>

<h3><a href="http://tedhagos.com/android/">1. android</a></h3>
<p>
  This part of the site contains notes on Android programming. If you already know to code in Java and you are new to Android programming, these notes might be of some use to you.</p>

<h3><a href="http://tedhagos.com/html5/">2. html5</a></h3>
<p>
  notes on HTML5 programming and other related technologies</p>

<h3><a href="http://tedhagos.com/misc/">3. misc</a></h3>
<p>
  things that I cannot categorize, it is also possible that I don't write a lot of notes about the subject, hence it is on the <em>misc</em> bucket. An example of a note that will fall on this bucket is <a href="/misc/jekyll-github/">jekyll + github</a> which contains my notes about setting up a site using jekyll and hosting it on github. I don't have a lot of notes about that subject, so it does not warrant a dedicated directory</p>

<h1>the author</h1>
<p>
  My name is Ted Hagos, these are my notes. I currently hold a technical management position. My tech journey started sometime in the late 80sâ€”Turbo C was on version 2.0, MS DOS was on 4.0, Summer 87 was what I would call a Clipper version and SideKick was my code editor, that was a long time ago. I worked for tech startups in Manila (Phils) doing software development in various capacities (tech leading, project management and executive work)</p>
<p>
  I was also a full-time faculty member at Asia Pacific College and IBM ACE (Advance Career Education). There, I taught Java, C/C++, OOAD (Object Oriented Analysis and Design) and OODBMS (Object Oriented Database Management Systems). Before joining Asia Pacific College, I also taught at AITI (Ateneo Information Technology Institute).</p>
