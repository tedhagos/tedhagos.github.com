<h2>About</h2>

Ted Hagos is responsible for this site. I currently hold a technical management position. My tech journey started sometime in the late 80sâ€”Turbo C was on version 2.0, MS DOS was on 4.0, Summer 87 was what I would call a Clipper version and SideKick was my code editor, that was a long time ago.
<p>
I worked for tech startups in Manila (Phils) doing software development in various capacities (tech leading, project management and executive work)
<p>
I was also a full-time faculty member at Asia Pacific College and IBM ACE (Advance Career Education). There, I taught Java, C/C++, OOAD (Object Oriented Analysis and Design) and OODBMS (Object Oriented Database Management Systems). Before joining Asia Pacific College, I also taught at AITI (Ateneo Information Technology Institute).
