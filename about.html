My name is Ted Hagos. These are my notes. 

<p>

I hold the Chief Technology Officer post at RenditionDigital International. I held various technical positions prior to my this one. I have been a tech lead, architect, PM and Dev Director. 

<p>

My tech journey started sometime in the late 80s. Turbo C was on version 2.0, MS DOS was on 4.0, Summer 87 was a version of Clipper compiler and SideKick was a popular programmer's editor. That was a long time ago. 

<p>

At one time I also held a full-time faculty position at Asia Pacific College and IBM ACE (Advance Career Education). I taught Java, C/C++, Object Oriented Analysis and Design and OODBMS (Object Oriented Database Management Systems). Before joining Asia Pacific College, I also taught at AITI (Ateneo Information Technology Institute).
