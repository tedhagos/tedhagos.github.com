Java applications can communicate to many relational databases like MySQL, Oracle, MSSQLServer and SQLite to name a few. Each of these databases have their own ways and mechanism on how to manipulate data. When you use anyone of these databases, you will generally do so using a client software that is usually provided by the database vendor. If you use SQlite for example, you will manage the database records using the SQLite executable which acts as the database client software. This client allows you to enter SQL commands via a command prompt. 

Our application will be the client.
