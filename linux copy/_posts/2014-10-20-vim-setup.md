Most of Vim addons can be installed manually, you just need to put them inside inside `~/.vim/` folder, but it's a lot simpler to automate that install/config process if you use some sort of a Vim package manager. There are a couple out there, one of them is **Vundle**. First thing to do is to grab it from github. 

`$ git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`

Add the following lines to ~/.vimrc

~~~
set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/vundle/Vundle.vim
call vundle#begin()

Plugin 'gmarik/Vundle.vim'
Plugin 'MarcWeber/vim-addon-mw-utils'
Plugin 'Valloric/YouCompleteMe'
Plugin 'tomtom/tlib_vim'
Bundle 'snipmate-snippets'
Plugin 'honza/vim-snippets'
Plugin 'garbas/vim-snipmate'
Plugin 'tpope/vim-rails.git'
Plugin 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
Plugin 'tpope/vim-surround'
Plugin 'tpope/vim-sleuth'
Plugin 'tpope/vim-markdown.git'
Plugin 'ricardovaleriano/vim-github-theme.git'

call vundle#end()
~~~

You don't have to install all those plugins, go and read up what those plugins are supposed to do before you add them to your own vimrc. 

If you used Vim to edit .vimrc, you can switch command mode and execute `:PluginInstall`. If you didn't use vim to edit vimrc, you can start vim and install the plugins using the command `vim +PluginInstall +qall`. 

There are more instructions from the [GitHub pages of Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) 

## Resources

1. A working .vimrc is [available here](../resources/linux/vimrc.txt), rename it to *.vimrc* and put it in your home folder
