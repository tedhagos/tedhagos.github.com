Android is a comprehensive open source platform for mobile devices. It is promoted and championed by Google but they don't own Android. Google turned it over to the Open Handset Alliance so that vendors and other interested parties can fully participate in developing the Android ecosystem.  

## Comprehensive

Android is a complete software stack and much more. Android comes  with the following;

operating system
: this is the Linux operating system kernel. It takes care of interfacing with the hardware. It is also responsible for process control and memory management

libraries
: software libraries like sqlite, OpenGL, media manager, WebKit etc 

app framework
: these manager frameworks exposes system services to the application layer so that the apps you will create may have access to things like the window manager, content providers, location manager, telephony etc.

runtime
: a rich and stable runtime which includes the Dalvik virtual machine 

preinstalled apps
: comes with batteries included. You can immediately use the phone dialer, SMS messaging, email etc

sdk
: this is what you will use to create android applications. The Android SDK has the compilers and other tools necessary in order to create, compile, test, debug, sign and compile applications

hardware reference design
: describes the capabilities required of a mobile device so that it can support the Android software stack


## Open source platform

The entire stack of Android is open source, including the OS.  Android is licenses quite liberally and friendly to business. The Apache/MIT license of Android means you can extend Android and build applications using Android without having to open source your code
