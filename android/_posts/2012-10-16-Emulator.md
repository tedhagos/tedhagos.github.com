title: 2.5 Emulator

The ideal way to test android applications is to use actual physical devices. There is just no substitute for actual devices, you do not lose any fidelity between the testing process and the actual user experience. Your test experience will benefit too because there is no lag on response time while testing your app. This testing methodology, however, is not cost effective. Your test infrastructure might become prohibitively expensive if you will purchase quite a few Android devices simply for the purpose of testing. This is the reason why we have emulators. 

Emulators allow us to see and experience our applications in a variety of platforms. 


## X86_64 or X_86 System images

Emulation is notoriously slow. This is the reason why Google and Intel came up with HAXM to respond to the emulation speed problem. HAXM (hardware accelerated execution manager) is a hardware assisted virtualization engine (hypervisor) that uses Intel virtualization technology.  If you are a Mac or Windows user, you can benefit from HAXM.   

### Windows

You can get HAXM in two ways. You can either get using the Android SDK manager, you will find it in the **extras** section or you can download it from the [Intel site](https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager). Getting it using the SDK manager does not automatically install it, you still have to double click the downloaded installer just like the way you install any other Windows application.  

### Mac 

Similar to how you would get HAXM on a Windows platform, there are two ways to get it as well on an OSX machine. You can get it via the SDK manager or by downloading it from the [Intel site](https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager).  Install HAXM the way you would install any other downloaded binary on a Mac. Double click the dmg file and follow the prompts. 

The installer will ask you for the amount of system memory you would like to allocate for HAXM. Choose whatever suits you, I did put 1536mb, that seemed sufficient enough. If you want to change the amount of system memory allocated for HAXM, you will need to run the installer again. There is no utility screen for managing HAXM.

You can verify that HAXM  is running using the command

~~~~
$ kextstat | grep intel
~~~~

You should see the kernel extension "com.intel.kext.intelhax" 

HAXM is automatically started and stopped by an IDE. If you are not using an IDE, you may have to manage the HAXM manually. 

To start HAXM

~~~~
$ sudo kextload -b com.intel.kext.intelhaxm
~~~~

To stop it

~~~~
$ sudo kextload -b com.intel.kext.intelhaxm
~~~~

## KVM

## Genymotion 



## ARM images

If you are out of luck so much that you cannot even run Genymotion, you will need to settle with ARM eabi images. This method of emulation does not benefit from any acceleration, virtual or otherwise. The only
