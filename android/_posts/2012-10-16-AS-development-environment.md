Setting up a development rig for Android varies a bit depending on what tool you will use. We will use the Android App Studio but we will brush a little bit on instlaling the barebones SDK as well. You do not have to follow the barebones SDK install 

There are two different ways to install a dev environment, one is is via the pure SDK and using only the tools provided by the SDK  and some rudimentary programmign editor. The other way is using an IDE like Eclipse, Netbeans and Android App Studio

The IDE is a monilithic way and the SDK is more involved. 

We will cover the Android App Studio. Why, because this is the tool endorsed by Google. While it is still in Beta, I don't know, get some words from other authors
