title: 2.4 Development Tools

---

Android development can be accomplished with some popular IDEs such as Eclipse, Netbeans and Android Studio. Eclipse and Netbeans provide plugins so you can use the android SDK from within the IDE. These IDEs even allow you to write UI components with graphical tools.  Eclipse used to be the official IDE for Android, but that has changed for quite sometime now. Android Studio is now the official IDE.
