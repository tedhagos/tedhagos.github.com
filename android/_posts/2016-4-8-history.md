title: 01.1 History

---

Andy Rubin led a small startup team sometime in 2003. They were building a software that could power a smart phone. Google took notice of it and acquired Android Inc. The first attempts of Android were not very impressive but phone manufacturers took notice and jumped into the bandwagon.

Shortly thereafer, 200,000 android devices were being activated on a daily basis (at the time of writing, over half million android devices are activated each day). The small-ish mobile phone software began to make waves.

Android’s snowball noticeably gained momentum sometime in 2008 - 2009—this is the time they began using sweet snack monikers on each version of Android; it has been unstoppable since then.

## Open Handset Alliance

When Android first came out, many thought that Google would become telephone handset provider, there were rumours of a **gPhone**. Android is not owned by Google, it is owned by the Open Handset Alliance which is, at the time of writing, 84 technology and mobile companies. Google is of course, a founder member of this alliance.
