title: Mounting Drives in fstab

---

The fstab gets read during the boot sequence. If you have a second hard drive that you would like to mount during boot up, put an entry to it in the fstab. Add the following line to fstab to mount a second drive

~~~
/dev/sdb1   /home/username/pathToMount  ext4  defaults 0 0
~~~

How do you know that it's **sdb1** or **sdb2** or something else. Use any one of these commands to find out the block devices

`lsblk`
`hwinfo`
`fdisk`
`hdparm`

Here is a [sample fstab](../resources/linux/fstab.sample.txt)
