title: How to Include other scripts

---

There are four ways to include other php scripts into the current file. PHP has four statements that allows us to essentially copy the contents of another php script and embed it on the script currently being evaluated. These statements are

1. **include("scriptname.php")**
2. **include_once("scriptname.php")**
3. **require("scriptname.php")**
4. **require_once("scriptname.php")**
