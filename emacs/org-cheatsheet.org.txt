** Inclusion of table of contents

Two ways of doing this. First one is in the /org-publish-project-alist/ declaration. Actually, you don't have to do anything in there. TOC is included by default, if the /:with-toc/ directive is not /nil/ the exported HTML will always contain a table of contents unless otherwise overidden by /OPTIONS/ variable in the org document itself.

#+begin_example     
(setq org-publish-alist
'((
  "mynotes"
  :with-toc nil
  :base-directory "/somedir/"
))
)
#+end_example 

The above example will supress the generation of TOC on every exported document. If you want to generated the TOC, remove the /:with-toc nil/ statement

The second way of generating TOC is to put statement in the export options of each org document e.g. if you have a document named /somedocument.org/, it might look like this


#+begin_example

#+end_example
