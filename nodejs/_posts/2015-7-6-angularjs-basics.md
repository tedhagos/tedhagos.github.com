Big picture

JavaScript, mishmash - Joe Crockford. Written in 2 weeks, but it evolved. So JS got a lot traction and it is making headway on enterprise. Enter AngularJS. This was done Misko Hevery (Google). Why


Why - Complete solution. No third party tools or libraries. Lots of documentation. Backed by Google. It is popular. Opinionated, it has prescription on how to do things. Open Source. So instead of using lots of disjoint scripts and libraries which makes versioning of apps play nice with each other, you want a single framework. It is testable

It is a time saving device. Saves developer time, hence saves cost. Code reduction. This is the single most important reason. 80-90% code reduction as compared to other technologies. Write, debug, maintain


Two way binding and Forms

`Code sample`

What kinds of problems does it solve, what is the JQuery code and what is the angular code

Cohesive, complete solution. All major pieces of a front end application, forms, binding, server communication, routing, accessibility, angular does all of this. Opinionated software saves decision making time. Gentle guidance, one angular apps looks almost the same as other angular apps -- learning curves and maintainability

API hiding - inconsistencies of browser - code sample, click

Full Stack affinity - JSP, .NET etc will find more in common with Angular than ala carte. 

Localization - The filters actually localize data as well

# Architecture

It is an HTML compiler. It peppers angular code into the DOM. diagram.

Angular looks at ng-app, what does this mean
then it looks at the ng-controller -- ang will control that portion of the page - angular kicks into high gear here

ng-click, expressions, ng-bind

Dependency Injection


## Single Page Application

The problems of building SPA

- DOM manipulation
- Routing - tracking where are we and where are we going
- Data binding
- Caching
- Object Modelling
- Module Loading
- View Loading
- Ajax
- Async calls
- History

JQuery, SammyJS, Zepto, RequireJS etc - these things may not place nice in the future. So maintenance should be a goal
