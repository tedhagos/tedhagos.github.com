title: 2.4 Hello

---


The traditional hello world  in node looks like the following

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
// filename : hello.js

var http=require('http')

app=http.createServer(sayHi);

function sayHi(request, response) {
  response.writeHead(200, {'Context-Type' : 'text/plain'});
  response.end("Hello Node\n");
}

app.listen(8000, '127.0.0.1');
console.log("Web Server has started");
{% endhighlight %}

You can run and test this program by creating a file named **hello.js** anywhere you like, but preferably in a directory under your user folder so won't have any issues with file and execute permissions. You can put this folder on your Desktop if you prefer.

To run the program, we will invoke the node runtime and pass along the name of our program.

~~~~~~~~
node hello.js
~~~~~~~~

The console should hang, then launch a browser and go to following url 

~~~~~~~~
http://localhost:8000
~~~~~~~~

## Code Walk Through

## Activity

1. Launch a terminal window
2. Create a file named hello.js
3. Copy and paste the source file of hello.js as shown on the section above
4. Run the app


In this section, we will create the uninspired but traditional hello world program in node. 

You can pretty much write a node program anywhere you like, it does not need any special directory or folder structure. For the hello world program, we won't even need a directory. 

Create file named hello.js anywhere you like, but preferably somewhere in your user folder so that you do not need any special permissions create or run programs. On the mac, this would be anywhere inside `\Users\yourlogin`


While the repl allows you to write node codes, as a programmer, you will write your commands in a source file and then run it using the node interpreter. That's what we will do

{% highlight bash %}
mkdir ~/nodeplayground && cd ~/nodeplayground
touch hello.js
{% endhighlight %}

On a Windows machine, this might be accomplished with these commands

{% highlight bash %}
mkdir c:\Users\yourname\nodeplayground
cd c:\Users\yourname\nodeplayground
{% endhighlight %}

Then you can create hello.js using your program editor of choice. Node programs are javascript programs. So whatever you have used to write JS codes before, that should be fine.

Edit `hello.js` and put the following codes in it. This is the hello world example from the nodejs site itself

{% highlight javascript %}
var http=require('http')

app=http.createServer(sayHi);

function sayHi(request, response) {
  response.writeHead(200, {'Context-Type' : 'text/plain'});
  response.end("Hello Node\n");
}

app.listen(8000, '127.0.0.1');
console.log("Web Server has started");
{% endhighlight %}

To run the example code, type `node hello.js` from the terminal. Launch a browser session and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
