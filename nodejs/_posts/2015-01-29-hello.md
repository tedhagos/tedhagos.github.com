title: 2.4 Hello

---

While the repl allows you to write node codes, as a programmer, you will write your commands in a source file and then run it using the node interpreter. That's what we will do

{% highlight bash %}
mkdir ~/nodeplayground && cd ~/nodeplayground
touch hello.js
{% endhighlight %}

On a Windows machine, this might be accomplished with these commands

{% highlight bash %}
mkdir c:\Users\yourname\nodeplayground
cd c:\Users\yourname\nodeplayground
{% endhighlight %}

Then you can create hello.js using your program editor of choice. Node programs are javascript programs. So whatever you have used to write JS codes before, that should be fine.

Edit `hello.js` and put the following codes in it. This is the hello world example from the nodejs site itself

{% highlight javascript %}
var http=require('http')

app=http.createServer(sayHi);

function sayHi(request, response) {
  response.writeHead(200, {'Context-Type' : 'text/plain'});
  response.end("Hello Node\n");
}

app.listen(8000, '127.0.0.1');
console.log("Web Server has started");
{% endhighlight %}

To run the example code, type `node hello.js` from the terminal. Launch a browser session and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
