title: 4.1 MongoDB Setup

---

You can get MongoDB for Windows, Mac and Linux. The installation will also vary depending on what platform you are using. It can be installed via chocolatey if you are on windows, via apt-get if you are on Linux Debian (or derivatives like Ubuntu, Mint etc) you can  also get it on OSX via brew or any other package manager. If you are familiar with any of the package managers mentioned above, feel free to use them. Otherwise, you can simply download a precompiled binary from [mongodb website](http://mongodb.org).  Whenever you install a software using precompiled binaries, you will be responsible for updating that software. That means, when there is an update to mongodb, you will need to re-download and re-install it. 

## On OSX 

The precompiled binary will most likely be  in tgz format. 

## On Linux

Same as in OSX, it will be in tgz format.

## On Windows

This will most likely be in msi format. Install it the way you would install any other binaries in Windows. Double click and follow the prompts.
