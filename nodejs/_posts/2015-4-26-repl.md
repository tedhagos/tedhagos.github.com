title: 2.1.2 REPL

---

NodeJS includes a REPL utility. The Read Eval Print Loop is a pretty good way to start exploring node. You can type any node command in the repl and it will automatically spit out the results of what you typed.

$ node

The chevron sign indicates that the repl is ready to take on commands. Node is javascript, so you can type valid JS commands and the repl will evaluate it.

$ node
> new Date();
> Sun Apr 26 2015 23:01:58 GMT+0800

You can even type functions in it.

~~~
$ node
> var numarray = [1,2,3,4];
undefined
> function cube(num) {
... return Math.pow(num,3);
... }
undefined
> numarray.map(cube);
[ 1, 8, 27, 64 ]

The repl is just a good tool to have if you want to quickly test a statement or an expression. It allows instant feedback if a piece of code will work or not without you having to construct a proper source file.

You can end the repl session by pressing `CTRL C` twice on the terminal.
