      <title> Collections</title>

      <description>The Kotlin collections are actually direct instances of the collections in the JDK. There’s no conversion of wrapping involved. So, if you didn’t skimp on your study of collections while you were in Java, that will certainly come in handy now. Although Kotlin didn’t define its own collections code, it did add quite a few convenience functions to the framework, which is a welcome addition because it makes the collections easier to work with.</description>

      <title>Higher Order Functions</title>

      <description>The name higher order functions come from the world of Mathematics, in there, a higher order function is also called functional, functional form or functor, and apparently, they take the difference between function and values, a bit more seriously than programming folks.
 NOTE It makes me wonder if there a thing such as &amp;ldquo;lower order functions&amp;rdquo;, I don&amp;rsquo;t think this term was ever used, neither in programming nor in the world of Math.</description>

      <description>Node scripts are not that different from the other JS scripts you&amp;rsquo;ve written in the past. You also need to put them on a filename with a .js extension. While nodeJS programs can be constructed in the REPL, that&amp;rsquo;s not how we will run the example scripts in this notes. Unless I specify otherwise, when you see a listing like the following;
Listing 1 - hellonode.js
setTimeout(()=&amp;gt; { console.log(&amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot;); }, 3000); console.</description>

      <description>Routing table The routing table does not show using route print in OSX, this may have worked in Linux but not here. Use the command netstat -nr instead
Show/Hide hidden files Finder The OSX Finder does not show hidden files by default. A file is hidden if the name starts with a dot or period e.g. .bash_profile, .emacs.d etc. If you want to see these kinds of files in the Finder, execute this commands using the Terminal.</description>

      <description>Copy pasting clipboard to/from terminal Can be done either via xsel or xclip. Xclip is part of most modern installations, so you it may be there in your installation already. The common usages are:
You copied something in an X window (browser or editor etc), you want to paste the content to the terminal. Unfortunately the terminal doesn&amp;rsquo;t have access to the clipboard. But you can do this on the terminal using</description>

      <description>Most programs need an entry point or a beginning routine where all execution begins. Even the lowly &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; in Java requires a static void main as an entry point. Android programs are the same, it also needs it’s own version of the “function main”. But the entry point of an Android program isn’t a literal function, and its also not called “main”, — it’s a bit more complicated than that.</description>

      <description>Introduction Two basic questions to begin the discussion, (1) What is Java and (2) where is it used? Java is a platform, it has a (1) programming language (2) set of built-in libraries and (3) a virtual runtime environment or JVM; it&amp;rsquo;s short for Java Virtual Machine, some people also call it JRE which is short for Java Runtime Environment.
The Language The Java language is not so old, as far as programming languages go.</description>

      <title>SMS messages using USB Modem</title>
      <link>http://tedhagos.com/posts/send-receive-sms-usb-modem/</link>

      <description>This guide uses gnokii-sms to send and receive SMS messages using Linux PC. The project I was working on did not require industrial grade throughput. That is the reason I cannot justify the cost of WaveComm iTegra type equipment. The SMS project was ran on a Debian Linux. If you are using a different distro, use the packaging mechanism of your distro.
There were a couple of other solution approaches but I went for gnokii-sms.</description>
